very soundless product and low price other company
nice
the best poduct that i bought from flifkart it works superb like ac and price is also reasonable only rs 8698
cooler is big and wide maharaja brand trust y every thing is good about cooler create less noise only thing is that its motor is not powerful even in high speed rest all things are good but yes for one middle size room it is ok
it is one of the best air coolers at reasonable price have ever seen but the ventilation of the room is must for proper cooling but the size is quite big it will i hope create a space problem during off seasons the air supply is very good and its one of the essential part of the air cooler with the wool wood pads which helps to make super cooling afterall thank you maharaja company to make such a product in affordable and reasonable price
awesome air cooleri was looking for a cooler under this range and this has fulfilled my requirement this has the following features1 great air through the capacity of 5000 m3hr 2 comes with a large 65litre tank which can run overnight with ease3 great built that is a shockproof and reliable material4 you have to stop this beast at night because it has that massive cooling capabilityone small concern is mine and it is for sure that it is not a dealbreaker that it produces s
purchased after a lot of discussions and reviews i would say this the best which gives you the comfort needed best to for with no 2nd thoughts nice cooling low noise hope this should be energy efficient and used for a long run
very nice cooler cooling is very good there is no noise i reviewed a lot then only i purchased it if you want effective cooling you have to set it up at a window where there is cross ventilation without cross ventilation it will make environment humid lookwise it is very nice and material is strong
feedback given after using one week the cooler is amazing its making the whole room cooling you should install the cooler near to your windows the delivery was on time as well the delivery boy also very supportive
great deal 65 l quite big tank sufficient cooling for one medium size room 3 modes works well best in this range
i bought this cooler on heavy discount by flipkart cooler is build of good quality material it has a fast fan with powerfull motor pump air quality is excellent even for a big room a must buy value for money product
the good things1 very well packed good amount of thermocols to protect from transport damages2 sturdy body3 relatively less noise as compared to bajaj cooler i had earlierwish this was betterfor many purposes it is necessary to open cooler body opening the body of cooler is not very intuitive common consumers may not even attempt for fear of damaging something 1 easy opening of side frames to change pads or clean the water inlets2 water balloon used to cut water supply au
excellent producthappy with resultnice air flowosm cooling
cooler works fine and it is inverter friendly
small wire and moter capacity is very low fan speed was not good out flow vent hole is above the lower part of cooler its very difficult to change water
perfect product for large size room
average cooling not much as expected by size and reviews of cooler cooling is sufficient maharaja whiteline should work on its cooling efficiency and reduce size by width can increase in height to maintain tank capacity
product was amazing cooling capacity awsum pls go for ahead a big thumbs up
good
received dalay 10 days cooler is ok when i was reveived switch damaged
big oneworking good 2days of use hope will work for long run
good product nice air flow and no noice
in this price good cooler
is good for many
it is an awesome product light weight easy to use and having lot of features
the product doesnt cool as rated by other customers the cooling is very slow very wrost product i recommend to not buy this item wastage of money
looks like monster cooler it is working as awesome
very nice product thank you flipkart
very good
good cooler it occupies more space looks very large but good for hall it covers all the places
very impressive coolerpros stylish energy efficient 165 watt very good air throw and cooling summersible pumpcons very bulky take more place than other no wheel lack of ice box
best cooler i bought 6884
excellent cooler in this price rangepros1 air throw is very powerful even when u run it at slow speed setting 2 cooling and tank capacity3 ergonomics cons1 if you want to clean the cooler then opening the pads is very cumbersome process if you have placed it on some flat surface then also draining the old water is very difficult overall v good cooler apart from above cons and considering price
cooler not provide cool air because 1year experience
a good product in budget
packaging excellent value for money product
delivered within 2 days working good
efficient for large roomspros1 low noise of fan2 inverter friendly3 cools large rooms fastly and easily4 it have aroma chamber in which you can add tablet of frangrance to counter smell of woodwool pads5 it have 2 section for air flow which means you can adjust it to get air for double decker cot equallycons1they should have provided stand of castor wheel for it to move2 it should have ice chamberwill update more about it in future
better than the steel cooler less noise and value for money
dont buy maharaja whiteline coolers they have cheap aluminum motors that are good for at max 2 years repair cost of these motors is so high that u would want to sell rather than repair them
very nice product and delivery is satisfied
no quality product1 the wood wool has started falling out from the next day2 out of two led indicator has found not working on arrival3 the air swinger is already giving noise when moving which never used to be in my old cooler which i am using since 3 years4 the quality is no way machine to branded coolers5 anti bacterial tank has been bacterial now as there is no way to clean it so congested to maintain it cleanlyin my way think before you buyac has option to aut
air throw is very good it makes room very cool in just half an hour full tank capacity is 65 litres which stays up to 5 hours it makes big living room colder not very much noisy

value for money
nice cooler
fantastic product great cool
dont buy just by seing the comments dont know how people review and rate the product cooling is ok but when it comes to fill the water you would need inlet pipe to fill the water we cannot open from the backsides to fill the watercleaning is highly impossible because there is no way you can open and clean worst design other small small branded companies provide all those facilities but this is worst product design totally unhappy with this product

worst
cooler chilled the room very fast
its good but size is too big
its huge and secondly its as good as ac but the problem is you cannot control the cooling its good if you have a 1500 sqft house
it is perfect for your daughter marriage items no doubt it is big and it is room cooler
amazing product it works wonders in 45c and always go for wood woolen pads as theyre better than honeycomb
very good product dont think much more go for it absolutely value of money
it is big moving it is problematic it would have been easier to clean if the side panels were easily removable does a decent job of cooling the room
good product

simple super
good product
working great three side cooling pad has increased its efficiency the fan speed and airflow amount could be better it is very difficult to put water from the front a lot of design flaws but at this price point its better than other brand products for optimal comfort and cooling the cooler needs to put outside the room in an open space or near the window of a wellventilated room
awesome product if possible pls provide wheel stand with product
good product the only draw back is there is no space for putting ice
unable to open to change water or grass
nice product with good blower and fast cooling a real satisfaction for money
dont buy any one

its good for mid size room apart from cooler design and plastic body electrical accessories are of average quality one concern nowhere given in manual how it will be opened and internally cleaned
nice cooling
better than expected air throw is really good to cool 400 sqft space it takes aprox 25 minutes in bangalore overall good buy

thanku flipkart nyc product
fan speed is slow every thing else is perfect
very nice and perfect cooler in this range thank you very much flipkart team for provide us but one thing its not working in 40 to 48 degree temperature
cooler is good but size is very bigand trolley are not provided
very smoothgood product
if you can provide trolley wheels stand along with the cooler it would be awsome and 5star product it is bit difficult to find a stand for this particular model as it is a jumbo one
the item is just perfect and my mom has this since last 3 years ans now i have this too perfect product
light indicater and l1 l2 not showing product
cooler is good but only auto swing is not working
great qualitycooling is nice
nice product
super cooling capacity excellent desert cooler
not that good that mentioned
writing after using this air cooler for more than a week pros1 best pricing compared to other coolers with overall same specifications2 the body looks durable and attractive3 less energy consumptioncons 1 the motor doesnt feel that powerful2 makes more noise compared to my old symphony jumbo 70 lconclusion according to me if someone is looking for a branded plastic body cooler with an overall nice performance and also in range of 7k they must go for it
its awesome cooler huge cooler like bahubali super tough body and serve it purpose of cooling big space in no time very happy thanks maharaja and flipkart
finalize in 65k so very nice budget cooler
ok fine work
worst cooler ever poor cooling fan speed is too slow even my normal ceiling fan provides better air worst product from maharaja and flipkart sad part is they do not refund the money as well only replacement option is availablevery disappointed from flipkart
worst
i am happy
thanks i happy
superb
super
nice worth for money
cooling is ok fan speed is good must buy if u want best cooler in summer fantastic delivery too
cooler is good for a big roomonly thing that i didnt liked is the the inlet given for putting water manually inside the tankthis cooler is only feasible if you can buy a inlet pipe which should be used to fill the tank by connecting it with tapso for all the buyers please keep that thing in mind before buying it because that point is not mentioned anywhere in the descriptionfan speed cooling capacity and rest of the features are excellent
i got 7199 best in segment
good product in this price
pros big in size give cool air good air flow not too noise and better than symphony jumbocon no stand and problem in water filling because the cap is small
durability is questionablecooling is normal
very good cooling it will really cool the room very efficientonly demerit is the lack of wheels u need to get a trolley if u want to use it movable
superb
very nice product
product is very powerful cooling capacity very good
not up to the mark in didplay front side l1 l2 blinkings are displayingbut the same is missing in productfan speed is not up to expectations and cooling also very lessfeeling humidity in room over all experience is average product i can give 3 out of 5by seeing previous reviews and experiences i had bought it but i dont recommend to others

super cooling
awesome product
its really worth every single penny it works like one ton ac provided that your room has proper ventilation i generally keep cooler near to window so that it can pull fresh air from outside and as a result i get very cool air one more suggestion please dont buy cooler which are equipped with a blower fan always go for the cooler equipped with metal fan like this one in one word this compton cooler is amazing if you find the review helpful please thumps up happy summer
i bought crompton ozone 75 desert air cooler in the month of may 2018 summer at its peak i live on top floor so my house gets mare warmer in comparison to other flats placed the air cooler in hall near balcony the device is elegantly build and performs very well crompton has introduced a very good product pros1 sleek design 2 water tank excellent 3 wheel are very good in quality no problem in mobility even when the tank is full 4 child locks in wheel 5 hone
great packaging by seller as this was the most important point while transportation from jaipur to chennai secondly product is quite huge and air throw is very much nearly 13ft at 2 speed and will give good breeze cooling is satisfying due to honeycomb cooling media no need of filling water daily price is high but product is quite satisfactory compared to others only drawback is the motor power is 190 w rather than 220w which should be coorected on specs information on flipkart good j
delivery was delayed by two days except this everything is quite finesafely packedair flow is good run silently even on full 3 speedice chamber is pretty good and instantly starts giving cool air after putting ice in itconnecting wire is kind of short lengtha foul smell comes for the first time you put water in itbut it ended within 34 hrsmoving wheels are quite reliablewheel lock works good
cant go wrong with crompton brand in punjab this does an excellent job during this summer with temp between 35 42 the looks quality motor are great and i have been using it indoors the air flow is good and have been using at lowest speed in my 1216 bedroom and need summer blanket with it at top speed it easily cools my 3615 lobby which is great as far as water goes it lasts 15 hrs without worrying 88l capacity very easy to move even when water filled to full capacity never g
a great cooler in great price compact and great design body is made of good plastic and the cooling effect this cooler is too good even on a slowest fan speed ut gives best resultrecommended to allalso one thing i need to mentioned is the delivery man great guy helps me a lot to get this product
its an awesome product and i am not making any fake comments here i bought this just for trial to have a healthier ambience at home and i am happy that i made this choice it cools a room and keeps it cool all day and its best if you put it near a window or open door so that it pulls fresh air huge savings on electricity eco friendly and comfy
air throw is very goodlow noise and best cooling on medium speedmotor of fan is partially covered with plastic to protect water fall on itoriginal crompton motor very durablewater level can be seen clearly from outside body of cooleryou can fill water very easily from front side of cooler a big box is available to open and close it after filling water55 litre tank is enough for 10 hours cooling honey comb pads very good quality plastic body is
its been 6 days that i am using this cooler we have 1515 room after buying this cooler what i love is it has strong solid body so dont worry that it get broken easily you can fill water from front and back and give very cool air my room feel like its december in april i have to use extra blanket in night while sleeping it has capacity of 75 litre water which last for 2 days but i love to run cooler on pump for 1 hour it cool the whole room then only air mode and it gives awesome cool
very good quality product better than my expectations if you provide good ventilation it does nice cooling then i could feel the air 25 feet away couldnt try more than that but i think you could feel it a bit more far away as well water easily lasts for about 89 hours good in this price9200 range after 10 percent discount
delivery was on time flipkart service was awesome on time but the cooler doesnt seem to be so costly as it doesnt cool really well even after filling it up with full water it can be ok during warm nights but it wont make you feel any ease in hot conditions the plastic build also looks very cheap and below standard i am ok with it but not very satisfied
water pump is not throwing a lot of water thats why its throwing warm air not satisfied with this kind of pump quality i have paid a lot for this not worth the money there is no work of ice chamber i need a partial refund
a quality product from crompton it looks exactly like in the website is easy to set up and use please refer the room size charts while buying from the product line this one is meant for a somewhat large room there are 3 speed controls a couple more on the lesser side would have been better the smell from the cooling pads reported in a couple of other reviews was there but mostly dissipated within the first 8 hours of use finally this cooler consumes a lot of water 3lhr so it w
great job by fk faster delivery awesome product i got brand new air cooler at first i checked its sounds not bad as i read in reviewair delivery is much better one thing to say delivery boy most helpful so guys must go for it but i have doubt is this model same to ozone 55 because i ordered this got ozone 55 according to sailer both r same then why fk shows different model price
a good cooler by crompton the height of the cooler is about 3ft 10 inch color is nice plastic body is average air blow is good at any stage 12 or 3 air swing is also 3 choice when you switch it on for the first time after filling the water you will feel the nice cold air you will feel cool if you use it according to the weather there is a ice tray on the top overall a good cooler i will give 45 for design 35 for plastic body 45 for fan speed 45 for fan swing
very bad ever packageing by flipkart i have seen when i open its outer layer its been already open looks like used product air throw quality is not good as expected its water meter is very top of its water tank if you want to see its minimum level of water then u have to fill atlest 50 liter of water no any support of up and down its air wing and its not cover very much area overall just ok not very satisfied
great product this come with very nice packing by seller not a single crack or scratch in it also its brand new mfg and truly original generally people avoid this type of stuff online but i try also have return policy for any damage so i ordered it and within 3 days they delivered this amazing room cooler now come in price range its little costly but crompton didnt compromise quality major features already you can see in description other than this fan is little noisy and its wit
its been 10 days since im using this air cooleronce it is on we can feel cool breeze in 10minbut we feel humidity if we use it for more time which is common with air coolers easy to move and fill water cooler need to be drained often knob is down below near wheelsediting here after 3 months use i used hard water for 3months with frequent draining after 3months pump stopped pumping water and releasing hot air once it is oni opened and cleaned pads pump and water distribution pipes
crompton offers this range of coolers ozone with multiple capacity of water tank though the fan motor and air flow capacity remains the same which should not have been the case i bought the 88 litre model satisfied with cooling but the castor wheels are not strong enough for the weight of 88 litre filled water tank suggestion is to go for 75 litre instead of 88 litre variant
its vertical swing quality is bad when you set to upward then automatically it goes to down due to this air goes to down we cant set direction as we wantvertical swing is uselesswater filling opening box is too small when u fill with jug many water goes to outside cooler ice chamber is useless ice cube water goes to 88 liter chamber how some ice can cool 88 ltr ice chamber need to direct connect to honeycomb pad and slides that it cool instantlyit make some noise too during

very happy with this cooler its giving fine cooling at less speed inside the house also got very less price as compared to market price got with very good packing thanks flipcart
awesome product with great cooling effect no need to put ice it will feel like running ac with fan cooling effect is really good go for it without second opinion
its a very good coolerquality id good water capacity is very good but it will be finished in fee hours nlyit can make a big room coolonly drawback is short power cord and its a bit noisy even in low speed over all its a very good product
value for moneypros1cooling effect gives better cooling2air delivery strong and powerful fan3capacity 88 litrescons1noise fan noise and water dripping noise2material used looks like cheap plastic in some corners3power cable too small really need an extension to useonly for people who wants to sleep in silent place dont buy this

flipkart delivered crompton desert air cooler 88 litres well before the schedule date before buying i compared with bajaj desert coolers here crompton seems to be much better based on the fan speed and quality water tank capacity of 88 litres is much needed crompton gives honey comb cooling pads for better cooling compared to wood wool it cools the room efficiently which makes us much comfortable in summer of chennai city
great product
wow great job flipcart fast delivery product arrived 2 days before expected date product is good and value for the money thanks
using it for last 10 daysone of the best coolers i have come across got it at a price of rs 8099 had a lots of research about coolers before buying it and here are my suggestions1 proper cross ventilation is required for optimal cooling so install it near the window where natural air circulation occurshoneycomb cooling pads are good as it has larger pores for air suction2 calculate air delivery requirement for your room desert coolers are generally meant for large rooms and hal

i am writing this review after 2 months of usage prosi am using this cooler in hyderabad around 11 x 14 sq feet room it perfectly really suits for this whether condition air flow is excellent it has an ice chamber easily movable using the 4 wheels providedlight weight vertical swing if i fill complete 75 liters of tank i get it for almost 16 hours i feel better performance when i open windows and use a tray of ice in the cooleryou can easily remove old water by pl
in gurgaon at 45 degree it is working on speed 1 like ac very happy with it finishing is not the best but it really does not matter when it give such cooling
this is a wonderful product at the mentioned price rangethe capacity of 75l makes it a wonderful to use product with one refill for upto 3 days6 hrs each dayit is easy to move and filling up of water with an inlet pipe can be done very fastthe inlet is in the front allowing external pipe to be fitted very easilythe cooler take 5 mins to reach full potential and then it cools the room so easily and effectivelytemp for a medium sized hall comes down from 40 to 28 celcius in 15 mins
cooling is good it depends where you placing cooler dont place the cooler close to window the humidity will be high keep the distance of atlist 89 feet from window and open the window ive already tried the same previously it was close to my window and it felt like more humidity wet body so irritating but now the distance is 9 feet from window and the right side of the cooler is face to window and the cooling is awesome now im decreasing the fan speed at night
ordered on 22nd feb 21got delivered on 25th feb 21fastest delivery by flipkart i thought its to early to give review about this probut after 3 months of usage here are my reviewssuper fabulous coolerno need for an airconditioner have been using this cooler throughout the summer getting good sleep at night with my whole bedroom getting cooled when turned ondidnt face any issues with this cooler till date why to purchase costly air conditioner and bearing more electricity charg
i went on to buy this cooler reading the already posted reviews this device is awesome cools my room in 5 mins even though i never operate it on full swing the room gets really cold at night to the extent that i require something warm to cover myself up keep up the good work crompton
its a very good cooler cooling capacity is very good the best thing is that i have moving the cooler with full capacity 88l from one place to another i have used the ice chamber only once then i dont used the ice chamber bcoz the cooling capacity is very good and u dont need the ice after used 10days i have post my review without any 2nd thinking go for it
awesome productafter comparing with various brands like symphony usha orient i have chosen this i got this for 7600 works efficiently by placing it in a good ventilation area and run at low speed for better cooling can go for it without any second thought and you wont regret your decision
best of bestits a king of desert cooler plastic could have been better but thats not at all issue you can close your eyes and hit buy button very less noise great air delivery best cooling with 4 way deflection you may need extra extension board for this moving such heavy tank is easy on wheels there is lock too just beware of children at home they can easily put handfingers inside
crompton ozone 88 cooler was amazing we are fully satisfiedthanks to flipkartoverall experience is good value for money i recommend to everyone that you can buy this cooler without any doubt
good air delivery this is its pro and con because of heavy air delivery you cannot use this as fan otherwise this is very good if you live in hot dessert area do not buy if you are from humid coastal area it is not effective by a powerful fan instead
cooler is excellant giving air upto 15 feet in the room size 1215 feetgood design with no water leaks 3speeds even good cooling at lowest speed and used in summer with 40 deg c noise is morebut bearable honey comb mat is added advantageas per specs it consumes 190 wattsmovement is easy with castor wheels electric chord length is only one meteroverall best cooler in its range recommanded to othersi a rao
have been using for almost a month now one thing you definitely need to know is keep the cooler where fresh air ventilation is there otherwise the room will just become humid the cooling for me has not been that great dont know exactly how it provides maximum cooling and not make the room more humid using it in pune climate it partially does the job for me if anyone has had good experience with the product can help me out on how the maximum cooling can be achieved
best product packing and delivery i love this product i am totally satisfied with this product honey comb pad is good for extra cooling at this price it is a good deal
though the product is very good but the flipkart service is not upto the markfirst they sent me a damaged product with case openno shrink wrapbroken plugmultiple damageseven though there is a replacement policy it took time and my patience to deliver good producti fully recommend to buy this product but not from flipkart
excellent buy was a bit hesitant seeing the negative reviews even in the hottest day this cooler keeps the room cool with ltl ice added from the top tray have been using for few weeks and very satisfied with the purchase
writing review after 1 week usage this is brilliant cooler at the price i got this for 7600 after bank discount looks brilliant with white and blue color combination easy to move and cools nicely i will recommend to buy this
good product by crompton and flipkart delivery is good product delivered with original packing same as given specification i am satisfy with product cooling is good air delivery also nice thank you flipkart
i am writing this review after using cooler for a month i would say it is silent enough it cool down your bed room within 1520 mins so you can put it on before going to room as of now i am running it on level on and most of the time i have to switch pump off in mid night as you start feeling cold very effective cooling and run well on inverter excellent build quality you may feel fishy smell for few days but it will go off once you change water
best in the classextremely light and awesome looks and very easy to maneuver around thanks to the 4 wheels at each corner with wheel locking feature talking about its main function that is cooling so let me tell you it worth every penny and cools the room in around 10 min of medium size it got 5 iron blades which works fine and tank capacity is very large i would recommend go for the lower capacity which would cost 1000 rupees less
excellent cooler i was actually looking for a plastic body beautifull looking air cooler which can replace iron body exhaust fan cooler in my 500 sqr ft hall though no cooler can really replace the exhaust fan cooler but after using it for a week i can say that this cooler is the best among all and have excellent air throw with high cooling with no noise level and nice looks i purchased it after a lot of research and i am happy with the performance only better option is crompton optimu
writing this review after using this cooler for 4 months in nagpur where temperature goes till 48 degrees and is an extremely hot regionlight weight sturdy stylish does not make a lot of noise either this cooler will work absolutely fine until march but during the months of april and may when summer will be at its peak it will work only as a personal cooler and youll have to keep it hardly 1 meter away from yourself to feel the cool air
this is a cooler so please do not expect ac like cooling this provides good amount of cold air the room may become humid in placesregions with higher humidity so please use cross ventilation this is a value for money product and it is pretty big looks very good in room the air throw is sufficient for rooms with 150250 sqft size the delivery was good and the delivery personnel went out of his way to help get the huge package to 2nd floor thanks a lot
the cooler was home delivered it came in good condition the cooler operation is simple the wheels are sturdy and it is easy to move around the main problem is with the manual the manual does not give details on how to clean the filters and how to drain the water tank the manufacturer could have created a simple youtube video on how to do this and not left it to the amateurs
its excellentwill feel some odour for 1 or 2 days due to honeycomb but then the smell will gopls dont forget to have some space behind cooler otherwise humidity will increase i felt the same but when i changed locationit if giving wonderful resultsrequires ac comforters after 2 hourswater tank capacity is good and it will last for more than whole night in continuous usewater level indicator is very clear wheels are good and locking system is also there overall worthy and good
giving this review after 4 months usage this is really good cooler cooling 1211 bedroom within 2 hours but proper ventilation should be there lit it sound is there i think the sound is common for all coolers this is good recommended to buy
wonderful product as expected reduces the room temperature nice air flow intial use will give a stink smell after first five hours everything seems to be normal ice chamber does its job for best results mix some ice while filling the tank cord length is small but manageable flipkart delivered in a week packing was perfect 5 for now will re review after few weeks
loved it excellent air thruogh i searched almost 15 days for best cooler finally got good one with reasonable price thanks to flipkart and crompton
air throw is very disappointingi thought it was a good cooler but its not they mentioned that it is for 450sq feet but it cant even cool my little 150sq feet room in 40 degree temp also i have tried all the way for ventilation but it always creates humidity and thats the bad part i suggest to dont buy this you can even buy a local brand cooler from the show which far better than this
product is good with good look and compact designairflow is also good while considering for medium hallbut the problem is if you try to adjust ventsblades they will automatically bend downwards due to airforce it would be better if they stand still however we want
i have purchased this cooler from flipkart its an amazing products value for money you have to use blanket if you run this cooler at high speed even in hot hummid summer guys please go ahead and buy it this cooler can chilled a room size 400 to 500 sqft thank you flipkart i love this product
after use of one month very nice product work well less sound better cooling
its excellent product from crompton superb cooling without any sound light weight beautifully designed very good qualitythanks flipkart for amazing producti am satisfied with this purchase thanks a lot to seller and flipkart
it is old model and dont have outlet for draining dirty water we have to clean it manually and do lot of physical work usually the water becomes stinky once in a month we have to remove the screws and use motor to pump out the water the screws are not stainless steel so they get rusted easily and makes it difficult to remove the wheels get stuck within a month theres no manual how to remove and clean honeycomb the only positive point is its air throwing capacity and ability to cool
very good productreliable product from the brand not disappointed this tym after returning usha air king which was a wasteyou can go for this one for sure good air thrownice cooling ice chamber castor wheel evrythng working just great only one thing which i want to highlt is just the front louver the osclitor is good working perfectly but the front oscltor should hve been better overall great buy go for it
value for money but bit noisy good enough for large rooms need good air cross section water capacity is hugegood air throw noisy enough to keep outside cant watch tv while cooler is in room
i baught this cooler looking at the number of reviews and rating as i always do and as expected cooler built quality is good but the main function of cooling has a design defect the water supplied through the channel has some design defect because of which none of the honeycomb panels gets wet completely and hence cooling effect is very less people may not have noticed this if they are from relatively not that hot places like pune mumbai or bangalore etc i would not recommend this product
very good product if you have a cross ventilation in your room so this product is so nice for you very less noise and give a instant cool air a little humidity fan speed is very good appropriate value for money
it is a very good product you must buy it it has three side honeycomb pad and dis cooler gave a very nice air flow its exact height is 10 cm and you dont be hesitate to buy this product it has good swing and nice water tank of capacity 88 litres and i got a good delivery by flipkart and crompton is a good brand
not a great product the finishing of the product is not look like it is branded one just looks like ordinary roadside product not expected this type of product from crompton i have shared my view after 2 days of usage the 3 star is for its price go for symphony this is not trust worthy
good
this product is very nice and good the motor was working good at very speed and very cool
excellent air cooling the water will last you easily for two nights n the cooling gets real effective if u place it near a window n yes just make sure you change ur water every week so to keep it clean n free from any smell its size is similar to ur 16 l fridge but much slimer n yeah thats all for now but will update my review soon after quarter year
cooling is excellent even in large hall delivery of the product is really fast i got the item in 2days first time i am experiencing this fast delivery and packing of the product not good time god there is no damage found in coolercons1 cooling the room is very fast2 air flow also good3 fan blades are made by metal because of this blades doesnt bend while cooler is running4 motor is also made by crompton5 ice adding chamber also really cool6 coaster wheels are really
if placed in a well ventilated area the cooling of this desert cooler is pretty decent the water tank of 88 liter is enough for a full day continuous use built quality is robust the delivery experience was very good as the product was delivered with proper company packing and was handeled with care
cooler is good but air up done setting is not good but all is ok i am happy you can purchase this cooler very nice product
to be very honest with you i was a bit sceptical before buying this product wheather it will be able to live up to my expectationsbut after using this product for the last 5 months it has removed all the doubts i had yes a small shout to you guys over here its not a ac so dont expect it will cool the entire room within half an hour or it will work like a window ac and alli can share some tips which will definitely help you to get decent cooling experience make sure the water f
this is honey comb cooler with giant water storagei have one thing like very much is that air throwi am satisfied with this coolerpros1good air throw2chill room quickly if good ventilation3invertel competiblecros1some time its make very humidity in roomit depends on climate2 in high speed its make very noise but adjustable
good product delivery boys good best coler thank you for filipcard
received a replacement for previously delivered damaged product replacement process was hassle free kudos to that this is a good cooler for the price totally worthy of 4 starsprosvery good cooling effectgood breeze speed breeze can be felt even 15 feet awayconthe body is not very sturdy although it can not be called weak either
not a good body delivery of this product is not safe it get break working is also not good
doesnt look that much fancy but rest when it comes to work it super and never water drop from its windows
very good and fantastic purchase i love it crompton is a brand and its quality meet brand value just go for it
build is strong dimensions is good fan throw is very good goes to 20ft very easilywheels are strong can easily move even when cooler is full very good product at this price range
satisfied with this product super air flow amazing built quality height is good cooling is also good its not offering many features but i think its main function as a good cooler its work best for me i review this after 1 month of used
cooler is nice but have some drawbacks as well i will focus on only draw backs because whatever feature it claims it has them upto mark 1 it is useful only for one person2 it will work only when proper cross ventilation is available other wise would create unbearable humidity in the atmosphere of your room or house3 front flabs are loos ened after use and they can not guide the air properly so everytime you will have to guide them in your direction it will irritate you especially i
i would certainly recommend symphony cooler in this range because earlier i hav experience with symphony and now i had purchased this 1 month agosymphony is superior to crompton1 less noise2 better air delivery
well i was confused between hindware and crompton but finally i went with this only as motor king is crompton only air flow is awesomelight weightcoolness is fantasticif you trust on brand you can blindly go with thiswin win situation thank you flipkart for awesome delevery experience as usual
crompton 75l desert cooler is the best coolerits cooling effect is very good even in moderate temperaturecooling remains for longer time not only when it is onand it cools large area for effective cooling not like tower or personal coolervery happy with purchase highly recommended for better and effective cooling
excellent cooler work well only when window are open for ventilation provide decent cooling with water when ventilation is provided
air cooler is working well giving heat relief from summer heat provided cross ventilation is good less noise its better to connect water hose to air cooler directly and due to water evaporation the 70ltr water doesnt last for the whole nightit has inbuilt wheels sturdy to move across the room highly recommend this product
excellent air cooler i am very happy and good sellers and good flipkart
good product on fully hot summer if you are living in place like humidity area it not helps to cool you
working well and cooling is also greati liked this product and ill also get a great deal as compared to market price
delievered in just 24 hours after the order which is in good condition as it is well packed cooling was very good when compared to previous coolers worth the money paid for it good service too
fantastic air throw and yet quiet fan great cooling and cool design
i ama truly satisfied with the product it cools the room very well even if the temperature is more than 42 degree celcius i live in a place where the temperature goes more than 40 degree in the mid summer i stay on the top floor but since i am using this cooler i am having no problem due to excessive temperature which i used to face before you just have to place the cooler in the right place with the right and scientific procedure
better plastic quality than symphony better price honey comb panelssleek suggest every symphony fan to give it a try as it is better in terms of product quality symphony quality has decreased a lot in few years
good product given same model which one i choose delivered safely i love flipkart services that i owe till now thanks flipkart team for wonderful job you are doing
in short it is better than snowcrest 85 which is one of the best air coolers out there crompton machines are less noisy and the air throw is wide and thats where snowcrest gets beaten but on the bright side the latter throws higher volumes of air i personally think that crompton is best for rooms whereas snowcrest from hindware is better suited for bigger halls
the best in this price range with excellent air throw sufficient for a hall and adequate cooling adequate ventilation is needed to work properlyworks best when kept near a window and another window should be opened to push humidity outwater lasts for 1 to 2 daysthis cooler can make the difference in hot climate when it brings down the room temperature the new smell goes off in a week a good choice to combat summer heatps thanks flipkart for the brilliant delivery
pros the best cooling out there with 75l liter capacity and plastic used is also really good cons plugg in cable length is not even half meter and huge noise which will not allow you to sleep so what is the point it is like giving you an ak47 without bullet you have a wonderful gun but you cannot use it for the purpose you got it for
cooler recd in good condition from flipkart within delivery timequality of cooler is so wise as per expectationair circulation and flow is too good with honeycomb colling effectthanks to flipkart for providing valuable product
good product works best when kept near a window and when outside temperature is low it cools like a mini ac overall nice product solves the purpose in places where temp raises to 35 to 38 degrees
very nice cool breeze liked it very much
just go for itone of the best model and best cooling efficiency compared to all other companies but place it before the window and enjoy the air conditioning loving iti bought it for 9878 which is an offer priceloved alot enjoying the chilling room
feeling fantastic good air coolers size design is good compact easy to transport thanks to flipcart saving money and time
product is delivered before time from fks gurugram warehouse to noida it was received in good condition however few scratches were visible when deliveredproduct is very good and working as expected cooling 200 sqft drawing room of my flat in hot summer end of april of noida city cool air circulation can be felt even at far ends of the room look of the cooler is also decent finishing is not that fine at corners and very easy to move within the room or outsidefull water tank goes e
i bought this after comparing over 30 different types of coolers its cooling is good but nothing compared to desert coolers like kenstar cyclone 12 what i observed that the cooling pads at the back are not properly soaked in water compared to side cooling pads this maybe the reason why cooling is lesser still its better than most coolers out there in marketprosit looks classy low noisehuge 70l tankpowerful 180 degree airthrowconsno indicator light no single switch to turn o
omni tech retail is great seller very good delivery fantastic product wish xtra good packing thank you flipkart thank you ekart and also thank you omni teck retail seller
its compolsory needs ventilation otherwise too hot if u have ventilation part in your room then go for it n feel like ac cooling using ice cubes in ice chamberanyway thank u flipu
i review this product after 2week usethis cooler is very good air throw is very good and nice coolingi use only water and cooling is niceif u add ice cube then you feel chilled air throw but u should proper ventilation in room open windows doorsi placed my cooler outside room in balcony windowmy room size is 180 square feet and having this cooler air throw covers my whole room noise is very low like table fan u can sleep peacefully
it is worth every single penny i bought this cooler for the indoor room where air ventilation is not much but this cooler performs really well for that room the fan motor is very powerful and the water tank is also has a good capacity it cools the room very well where there is no ventilation if it gets the air ventilation it will perform much better please go for it but keep in mind the service for this cooler is very expensive more than acbecause the honey grass are real expensive
pros 1 efficient blower fan2 wide distribution of breeze3 good appealtrendy and strong body made of abs4 full tank of water lasts a full day5 highly portable castor wheels6 silent operation at full speed compared with other brands7 cools larger area than advertisedcons 1 no timer2 no remote
awesome cooler cooling was very fast great work in summer
the main function that is cooling is amazing in this product capacity is great at 75 litres product delivery was really good and on time and also in great condition i will recommend it ober symphony coolers as it is more value for money and its cooling is incomparable
bought 2 cooler 1 by 1 gap of 2 weeks cooling amazing no need of stand coz of standerd hight compact size have ice chamber and strong body
this buy is true value for money white in colour beautiful to look at has wheels can be moved around easily tank capacity is awesome has fab cool and swing option also has a ice cabinet at the top of the cooler packing was good timely deluvary and we are really happy
excellent quality it is just like as a c very very cool air i recommend to all to buy it instead of local brands it is zero defect look wise very good delivery within 72 hours thanks to flipkart and delhivery for transporting safe delivery
plastic is of good quality no leakages as of now it blows air at high speed useful for long halls small rooms might have problem of noise keep it at some distance and see the effect modes work fine delivery was fantastic as it was delivered in mini truck carried by 2 guys
amazing air coolerit is almost 45 degrees here in gujarat during summersit is highly effective even in this temperature alsooverall this huge machine creates almost negligible noiselove this large yet effective air cooler from crompton
design is good but not worth itcooling is ok ok air distribution is also normalwill recommend to go for some local cooler as they deliver more chilled air than this one and are cheaper also
a very nice product easy to maintain quite efficient in function i will give it a five star rating
best delivery by flipkart and amazing cooler by cromptoni bought this ozone 55lt air cooler which has powerful air throw and quite good cooling capacity
very good product on time delivery good offer what we got happy to use for the chennai sunny days
a good cooler with a decent airthrowi resides in top floor in delhiit is giving perfect cooling till dateonly need cross ventilation for better circulation
awesome cooler i got it in just 7999 which was a great deal just use it in a well vanitlated room and it works like ac
wow super cooling delivery date is 27may but excellent and fast flipkart delivered on 24may
very nice product this is the best product among all coolers available in the marketcool calm very useful for big as well as small rooms
good looks very nice cooling good storage capacity good build quality strong wheels
size is compact look wise is good noise is lessdelivery and packing is good tooi paid cash on delivery cooling is good enough for a roomi think not suitable for big hall
cooler is very compact and movable look wise greatperformance was good but not excellent as in extreme heat it doesnt cool as otherwise also difficult to clean the tank leading to stink
genuine feedback cooler is not so cool but below average it can prevent only the hot air blown by nature during hot climate in summer u can get the air like rainy day nothing else
superb cooler and working like 1tonac in my room satisfied with this product happily go for it
best air cooler worth money it works like acand compatible with inverter also
great product by crompton nice cooling nice looks nice wheels go for itonly concern is length of power cord but you can manage this with extension cordboard
am writing this review after using the product for a monththe built quality is good and the cooling efficiency is very nice when it is placed near to the windowthe only concern with it is no water outlet found at the bottom when you want to release the water or clean the cooler
excellent i recommend it but you need fill drinking water 25ltrs for 10 hours approximately and using soft water drinking is best to retain the water pump life little bit noisy in fast mode useful for 20 x 11 sqft area
cooler is great but its tough to serve the water into it is little difficult if the water resources are less with you but in terms of cooler its great enough for big hall 25x30ft
first of all a big thanks to flipkart for the fast delivery i loved this product from crompton i recommend if anyone wants to purchase this product
it is good productusing it in the hall and sitting on the sofayou feel the cool airits at a decent height
crompton ozone 75 is one of the best desert air cooler in market it is amazing product with great featuresless noisy and good cooling is one of the most important feature of this cooler

very nice cooler and cooling very fast and plastic body is durable
after doing lot of research i bought this cooler last week air flow is very good cools room easily water lasts for nearly 1 day it smells early but it is bearable and lasts for 2 days only i want a cooler for indoor and it is perfect for it not so bulky as like other coolers you can move it easily even its tank is full so buy it without any hesitation
cooling is good with low noise and fan speed is goodpackaging was properly donestill it had a few scratches at the top of cooler but nothing majorlookwise its nicefull water tank goes for 23 nights so refill frequency is manageablevalue for money product

very bad quality very poor plastic material very cheap product showing it fr 17k and then discounting it and selling fr 10k still costly as per product received just fooling people in the name of brand third class product very much disappointed from flipkart requested for return and refund on the same day refund request rejected now forced to replace the product never buy crompton and use flipkart for buying
cooling wise its good but when we taking about noise its too noisy the water dropping noise will irritate youalso it comes with only honey comb pad its big disadvantage is the insect will easily inter through holein this price range go for bluestar windus cooler it is coming with hybrid pad
good product good pricing and good performancei love flipkartthanks
delivery of the product is very nice in short time it was delivered to me product is very good i am writing this after 7 hours of it use 55 ltr water finished after 7 hours this gives a natural chill air if you run at minimum speed during heavy summer season this will surely give comfort i am fully satisfied with this product

room is heated up even after using the cooler

very good air cooler
very nice product
best product in this price
best cooler
very bad experience this cooler not god and price high
while the fan and motor quality is good the problem with this cooler is its body the plastic is not very strong and the vent in front is problematic as the horizontal plastic pieces do not remain at their place leading to less air flow it is a big let down and request crompton to replace the plastic mesh in future rest of the body is also quite shaky
iron body cooler are better
very bed cooler its sound too much
fine product
cooling is awesome and colour quality and everything is very good worth of each penny loved it
searched many cooler and after reading many reviews i selected that cooler and realy its good cooling is realy good in ventilated area if you sleep in front of cooler you feel temperature around 1822 degree c but i found front louvers are not settled properly
it is very good cooler and cooling capacity is very good less noise and it is very good product at that price
perfect go ahead
nice product
cooling not proper
auto water filleup not theretoo much sounddifficult to cleancross ventiliter required for cooling
mony is wasted not ear
one of the best desert cooler my honest opinion that if you will give proper ventilation in front of the cooler you will get very cool air through like ac in this price segment this is superb you can go for it without any hesitationi will give 9 out of 10 for north and west indian summer days

want to spend 10k for a fan then go for it i never expected this kind of trash bad customer support from crompton the reason is we ordered this cooler based on the positive reviews but its doesnt cool even a 1010 size room even though room have good ventilation only the size of the cooler is huge ozone 75litre but not the output we contacted flipkart customer care for many times they took complaint and technicians visited 2 times but still the issue is not yet solve
its cooling is very nice easily cool 2 room
overall good product
closed your eyes and buy this cooler you will never regret
very nice super
excellent coolergo for it undoubtedly recommended

just like ac filling
good one
why its motor speed slowed down after using 1week
its a great product from crompton a true desert cooler
smooth to operate
good product you can buy it worth of money it is very useful when you have good ventilation in your room

nice air cooler butdont expect more air like acits just a fan with more speed and feel normal cool
best cooler
so far nice hope my reliance on crompton will remain the same
fabulous
the cooler is sturdy with a nice build quality and design cooling and the air throw rate is good even the ice charm works like charm however the water level drops too quickly even after its large tank capacity which needs refilling twice or thrice in peak season apart from it everything is great nice product from crompton
air throwing distance is very low
the cooler is good performance is great features are also good as compared to the priceonly one issue is there is with the body plastic quality is not so goodnd finishing could be better at some places like the buttons the grill some parts seem delicate in comparison to other brand like symphony coolersi have to keep my kids away so that the body does not get damaged but the price is half compared to other branded coolers hoping that it will provide tension free service for years t

not a good oneits not throwing any cool air and a lot of noisy
little noisy but cooling is awesome
cooler body quality is very bad its very fragile plastic body with the side doors knobs provided not so good once side door is opened does not fit again correctly refilling water is also pain with the knob provided at back being very loose and leaks water when refill is done unless you are very cautious there is no way to drain water you need to either remove water using mug or reverse the filler cooler upside down i recommend not to purchase this cooler and look at some other cooler wh
well designed cooler only one drawback i felt is the length of the power cable is too short working in good condition
its very good value for money
good product but electric cord is short
good
awesome
builtin quality is good sound is high
poor quality
writing after 2 month of use product is good very less noise and good air throw quality this is having only two side deflection up and down need to be done manuallyoverall good product got it at around 8500 so value for money

nice air flow feeling cold in night with this aircooler
dont go on flipkart review i purchase this cooler but totally waste of moneyp
low quality product silver alluminium motor windingair flow is very low i bought same model 5 years back and that has copper motor and the airflow is too gud but now crompton started making aluminium motors due to which airflow reduces about 50 and plastic body is also made of very cheap material
i am happy with this cooler thank u
not to the expectations low garde plastic used swing isnt adjustable water pump replaced 4 times in 3 months over all waste buy
excellentgrt productsometime use it in place of acdelivered on timein good conditionthnx to crompton n flpcrthope such service in future alsoone can buy to get full utility
awesome cooler very good quality and beautiful cooling good and not much sound u can go with this without thinkingawesome
nice product i like it
after use 1year 1 month use regular 3months water pump not working crompton use very bad product
best cooler available right now in the market
water pump motor failure after buy with in a month and no service provided by crompton
good quality product
apart from the drainage point which is not given anywhere makes it very difficult to clean rest is fine
this product is very good
good product
very poor quality and i received a defective product
water is not pouring from holescrompton services are not good
great air throw but keep it in a proper ventilation or else a lot humidity will occur
good product
very nice product
big and sound
awesome productthe cooler is very nice looking and best part is that it performs its task brilliantly the overall noise of the cooler is manageable the motor speed options are also very useful tank capacity is also more than enough the vertical swings works perfectly but one con is that the horizontal swing is fixed the only thing to keep in mind is that gives proper ventilation space to the cooler to achieve the optimum results delivery was done before the scheduled time
good
within one year you may lost fan motor without any special cause when it is runningstarting
excellent product
nice
very very bad product guys please dont buy this product overall bad experience on this product
simpleit cant compete a desert cooler or ac if you actually cant manage desert cooler fixing on your window i mean if you are on first floor where there is no way to hang a desert cooler on your window then only go for it you cant sleep first 15 days with it due to bad smell and after 15 days you have to compromise with it good for places which has no option for ac or fix desert coolerso i have simply waisted money on it due to few chamcha reviews anyhowhave purchased and
best
this product is very nice and its quality is also goodand a cold wind is blowing
cooler is goodthe only issue is the swigs that move up and down cant stay at one position
nice product go ahead
thanda thanda cool cool

product look is good but there is leakage in the screw of wheel when power on then water coming outside and floor become wet and slippery dont buy this they are cheating by selling defective products

air flow is not fast as expected the cooler is good not best even only for one person
good product
both motor and pump stopped working after one season only air throw is also lame doesnt work in june summer waste of money bought it for 8577 still waste of money wont buy any crompton product again
first of all thanks to flipkart for cutomer support but i am little disappointed with this product air flow is good but water flow is not good it does not speread proper on the cooling pad and the ice chamber should be directly connected with the cooling pad instead of main tank
good product

its amazing
the cooler looks good but it is as not effective as it is detailed the length of the pipe that connects the water motor is too short and keeps coming out
its amazing received on time there is no any damage cooling also very good thank you flipkart
disgustingi had ordered this product with very high expectation today on 19062021 i have received this product but unfortunately the product is found damagedand its such a disgusting product because we have to adjust the front grills after every 5 minutes as its comes down we have also use mseal to repair the damaged partreally we didnt expected such bad product from flipkart
i love flipkart for delivering the product in excellent conditionafter 2 months of usage the product working fine
wonderful
product is good but its air flow is not 45ft as it says its only 2025ft not cooling room that much but one good thing that for one person it is best you can install it in room as it does not cause humidity overall good product
very amazing cooler best cooler at this price point wonderfull colling feeting at ac
delivery is excellent as mentioned date in order time this rating is only for delivery i will rate later after use this cooler
does as quoted satisfactory overall
awesome cooler must buy it
gud product
flaps got loosed in a week automatically getting down
not sutisfiedvery bad product
reviewing after 1 month usepro1 less noise2 powerful enough 3 good cooling 4 plastic quality good5 so far motor is working finecons1 ice chamber uselessno extra effect instead directly put ice in cooler tank2power cord is little bit short
after 2 month review air through cooling is not that good and the major problem is when we start rotation wing mode than vertical wing clash with horizontal wing due to it some row of horizontal wings get damaged really disappointed after paying that much facing such problem while using rotationdont go for this cooler
very good product
good product from cromptonpros 1 air throw is good2 cooling is goodcons1 build quality is not that good
nice
it is best for living room
nice product
an amazing product does its work perfectly 1 suggestionfront lower move down with air flow so put lock system or anything that lower dont move
nice product cooling is good water consumption is little but high but the product is awesome
not recommended it works same as other cheap cooler
the blades keep on falling downwards towards the ground and all the air flow is directed on the floor didnt like that part need to manually adjust the blades bt in no time the blades direct towards the floor cooling is not much satisfying the air flow is good
this air cooler is so badest product in the world dont buy this cooler
this is very bad product so i request everyone please dont buy this product
cool
nice product
its ok cooler if put ice it cools good but it needs proper ventilation and think fan dont move that fast it can be better but it dont make noise plastic is not too bad not too good its ok cooling is decent but not worth money if its price is 7000 8000 than it is ok but it is not worth its price
delivery was on time and the delivery men were quite responsible and helping guysbut as far as functioning is concerned its just ok kind of product
overpriced and not a very good finish on the coolers plastic bodyotherwise its fine
good
we purchased this one on 26th june 2020 its working perfectly

i am disappointed with the product intially i ordered for ash color but i got another color placed replacement but again brought the same color which they delivered me intially coming to performance it is quite good but only annoying is there is no buttonknob to adjust the wind direction from outside
i am writing this review after using the same model last 2 yearsvery nice cooler and cooling
it can not throw air upto 20 ft and crompton has mentioned it can throw air upto 45 ft so dont fall for that
never expected the chilled air from this coolerairthrow is super but a bit swing sound

good cooler speed was also good
avg cooling and air flow also very less more time taken to cool the room

good product cooling is nice only problem is it creates lot of noise when the cooler is on in one room you cant hear any sound from other room
good cooler with many features but used low quality plasticotherwise product is very good
purchased after demo from my office coolerreally desert cooler in this prise segment best coller everpurchased 75 liter from rs 9000
1no cooler
good condition but but its pump switch is not available
cooler is good but i got damaged product
nice built qualityif you clean the honey comb panel every year you will get even betterperformance for many years
i am giving 4 stars for this product after using for 10 days
very good product value for money
everything is ok but the main problem is in the horizontal blade the horizontal blade which is used to change the direction of flow of air ie up or down getting down automatically due to the vibration of the cooler i have informed the customer care they raise a ticket for this issue i dont know when it will get resolved
very nice
good packing and no any troble
best cooler for indoor must buy it

cooler is good and quality also good but there having prblem like the water pump i switch it on first not working but i opened the cooler from the back side and sligtly touch up and after pump is working i think company have to see the pump quality also
worst experienceiam writing this review after using this cooler for one week iam not at all satisfied with the product no cooling at all its just like a normal fan no support from crompton people and seller rejected my return request without asking my feedback totally disappointed with this service
delivered at time and best products
plastic used is very light for wind direction but fan speed and cooling is good

its too good
excellent
excellent cooling good capacity can last a good 8 hours after filling to maxdoes work in humid condition in contrary to the myth that coolers dont work in humid areasits a desert cooler so probably it caters to needs of humid areashappy with product

this review i am writing after using this air cooler for a month time the air blow at minimum speed level itself it is very good the build quality is impressive the noise level is also less when compared with other coolers most importantly it takes maximum 30 minutes to cool your room i found the water consumption level is also less with this air cooler overall worth for money
produ ct is good but while moving from one place to another in home back wheels are bend after and cant replace as 7 days over i am very disappointed what should i do
cooling is best but 2 star deducted because little bit noisy and for smell after first time use
good fan speed that gives cool air easy to move
super cool nice cooler
as a brand i believe it works long and satisfied with product

i guess due to pandemic flipkarts customer support has gone into hibernation and due to that the wrong product i received thats sellers fault i got terrible experience with their support and talk about the product average built got defective wheels and it will trouble you to move it around easily when fully filled cooling is same as what a standard cooler does what you expect some gasfilled air conditioning from a cooler
excellent product by crompton one suggestion that it has no water removal tap from back side
cooling capacity is not good as i expect

water pump was not working after many calls followup neither technician visited or flipkart replaced the product first time worst experience
it is good in cooling and easily movable and working nicely but the buttons on the cooler are old in model

pros 1 awesome sound quality with2 best build quality3 comfortable 4funky awesome look 5 at this price cons 1 cant fold it like jbl headphones sound quality is same as jbl 460bt or may be better im using both at same time
honestly best earphone ive ever bought antinoise you can use it continuously for many hours very good battery backup boat earphones are maybe the best ever i got must buy
best in class of bass you cant feel the dolby type effects like the sound goes from left to right only you can feel a heavy bass and heavy sound from both the end no compromise in sound i felt if you look forward a clarity sound effects on your ears like dolby atoms then go for sennheiser or sony
i just loved it it is terrific product same as shown n wrking vry well thankuuuu flpkrt

sound quality and bass is satisfactory if you want something really extraordinary you may not get that its overall perfect as it suites all my needs the best part is the battery i charged it fully on the it came and its been 7 days ive been using aprox 3 hrs a day and i am surprised it shows 70 battery left my purpose of not having a cable and not charging again and again and getting a good comfort while using is achieved im satisfied
m using the boat since 2 years but not this colour m using the blue variant of same product the bass is awsome the build quality is awsome tthe sound quality also awsome i love it at the time of purchase my mind was going for the new brand like house of marleyjbl etc but i loved this and m order this item this is the best budget head phone in under 2000 sasti masti
sound quality is really impressive at this price its really good and comfortable headphone but for gaming i shouldnt prefer this like pubg if u purchase this only for high bass
great product good in sound function and battery backup works well with pubg and other apps overall it is a good product and with good price tag
awesome product i am happy and this is ultimate headphone for who travels rides and loves musiconce i charge it for very less time and its battery stands for 3 or more daysthis product is worth and value for money the build quality is also good
good bass and great battery backup could have improved the built quality for maximum comfort however this is best in its price range ear cushion padding could have been better to absorb the swet due to continuous usage

i have been using it for more than 10days and i have charged it only twice till now excellent battery backup i am a movie lover and these headphones lie around my head all the day it is very good option for virtual music experience but with prolonged use of hours together you may feel little bit pain of your ears as it covers all your ear apart from thay very good product value for money fast bluetooth connectivity overall excellent product

very good product i bought it today and i used it for the whole day finally im writing the reviewsound quality well balanced neither so loud nor so weak extraaaa bass is written on the packet but its bass is not so extraaa you know i will reccomend to buy this product this product will not make your money waste
the bass is superb in this when you increase the volume but sound quality interms of other aspects seems to be a bit average performanceits good for bass centric songsbut not good for romantic or heart soothing songs also there is a sound leakage in top volumealso feels bulky and weight compared to other headphones
awasm headphones in this price i got this in only 1500 which is the best value product awasm look nice sound quality everything good in thisi recommend you to purchase this product
received the product on time and the headphones are extra fabulous bass effect is too much works perfectly without any connectivity lag totally satisfied with the seller and delivery service recommend other users to purchase this at the cheaper price

as being a regular sennheiser user i was skeptical about buying this boat headphone but the very low price was the lure factor i bought this for gaming actually it works pretty well paired with my smart tv the sounds are not crystal clear like the sennheissers its just you get a decent headset for all your needs without burning your pocket it is comfortable to wear however after 2 hrs ur ears get hot feel a slight pain battery backup is good i didnt measure it though but it las
sound is good and pleasantearcups are comfortablebattery life is very goodonly drawback is they cant be fold and bass is also not very highhence if you are looking for bass then go for jblotherwise these are the best with best design and comfortnote there is half a second delay while playing pubgwhich in most bluetooth headphones is samehence go for the wired one or use them as wired headphones to get crystal clear sound
really its awesome headphone i loved it thanks to boat company and flipkart for offering this amazing headphone and great price
used it for around 3 months it works very well with bluetooth than the aux cable but its not a big issuethe only problem i faced is that i can not use it for long time because my ears are not completely into the ear pads for this issue i recommend boat rockerz 600 as i have used that earlier it is more comfortable and easy to carry as it is foldable
amaizng bass battery backup very good design superb and gym lover also love it
very nice quality the built in design is more than up to the mark the sound quality is awesome and is worth buying
super product looking smart and sound quality is superb base is extraordinary im satisfied in this purchase
its a very useful fantastic product when i connected with bluetooth with my phone and listened the song ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga in youtube i felt its sound is very pure and very sweet
great bt headsets for bass heads battery life is good built quality is also nice give it a time for 34 days to open up not for people looking for crisp sound good for bass type music and general video watching overall it is value for money product go for it
reviewing after 15 days i have to say this is the best headphone u can get under 2000 battery backup is superb it is nearly around 10 hours build is superb soft ear cups the only think i dont like is that these r not foldable thats sit although value for money i got it around 1300 during bbd
battery backup is awesome it works without charging for couple of weeks on using 12 hours daily sound quality is awesome and its same as compared to mi wired headphones may be little but more design is awesome but wearing it more than 3045 minutes it starts to hurt your ears cusion could have been much softer overall its best out there and recommended to anyone

i am highly impressed with this product it is best in every aspects specially for wfh and online classes anyone can talk on call easily i am highly impressed with delivery experience specially open box delivery
purchased on 6 october 2021 honest review on 20 september plastic build is solid and not much flexible not foldable too nd too much treble no bass is there u cant listen to anything at full volume headache cushioning are ok okwhen any bass comes it started to make abnormal noises
fits properly n covers full ears seems no heavy after using for too longbattery backup is really appreciable n sound wise perfectcan go for it
this review will be helpful for those who have used sony xb55ap i have used xb for 3 years so my review will be based on it1 for music its good but not anywhere when compared to xb 55 ap2 for gaming when using with cable there is no latency but when connected with bluetooth there is considerable latency also audio quality in game is not upto the mark footsteps of enemies is not audible from a distance but with xb it is better3 long time usage not for long time use as it

the one good quality is that its battery backup is excellent there is written only for 10 hrs but the thing is that from using day its my 6 day the battery is 70 wow amazing and one profit is that it both wireless and wired but i prefer you to use wireless because the sound the base is high rocking but in wired their is no bass and sound is lil low love this product

loved the producttoo comfortable for meseems very durable as they are still in great shape after about 4monthsi m a rough usera must buy if you are looking for bluetooth headphonesjust one thing to keep in mind before buying you cant use the wireless feature while gaming as delay is very noticeableabout 23 secondsbut while using an aux cable with ityou wont get any delay and a great sense of surroundings especially in pubga must buy from my sidebattery life is great t
honestly i had ordered the rockerz 400 first and they didnt seem that great but then i asked for a refund and ordered these 510 in blue and even though i was sceptical about it at first im glad i went ahead and purchased it because the headphones have great bass and sound and the battery backup is just amazing i charged them 2 days ago and i use them w bluetooth for atleast 3 hours a day and they are still at 90 or 80 the cushions for the ears are mindblowing they are so soft and com

in this price range this boat 510 is mindblowing dill its built is good but not portable and is good but its main thing is its super bass this was awesome i love it
amazing product checked many product read many reviews of this product trust im very happy only one thing i found its little bit large in size but its depend on your head size but its fit for me
its very good headphone i got it in 1400 during sale its bluetooth is working perfectly and battery backup is just awesome however i must say the soak used to cover ear is kinda uncomfortable if you use it for more than a hour your ear might hurt cause its not very smooth soak its kinda rigid however due to that it provide a good cancelation of outside noise but still it could have been made a little more smoother other than that its good and when you also getting 1 year warranty replace
sound was good battery backup is well enough u can listen enough music and video in a single charge very good products to buy in a small budget satisfied with this product but only concern is delay delivery i got it 6 day later other wise all ok delivery boy brings it very carefully packed well thanks for all things
its cool but not comfortable looking awesome unique design i lovethen sound quality is perfect bass is okay its not a extra bass it just marketing tricks but good bad on this price range you want boom bass you go to jbl t350 cost at 2500 but under 2000 boat rokerz shines
received product in 7 days got in nice and good packaging bass is very nice high notes are good lows and mids are superbfor music recommendfor gaming you have to use aux cable quality of aux cable and charging port is decent quality of headphone is very good thankyou flipkart
after 2 weeks of use1 comfortable fit on the ear causes minimal pain after long use2 loud clear and crisp sound quality3 after full charge lasted 4 days 4hrsday 60 volume i play pubg a lot4 both wired and wireless modes are good5 good call quality
it is awesome for all types of music except classical amazing bass and sound clarity awesome buy below 1500 i got it for 1299 on bbd
truly awesome sound is goodlightweightbass is too good romantic and silent song is hear good on this productbattery backup too good better than any only one defect hard to carry need separate bag not foldable
1its has no super extra bassliar no extra bass2sound on full volume cracks3not meant for metal or rock song4design its ok but i personally likes round 5battery back up it very good6can wear it on for 5 to 7 hours i played pubg using itfinally this head phone is for people who only listen to light music for long hoursi m not from flipkart review teamim just a kid who plays pubg
very good clarity and battery backup also i didnt charged yet using daily an hour from purchasing i am eagerly waiting for charge that it is almost 8 days over not yet charged still its running very good battery backup as well as sound clarity
i am using this headphone for like a week and below are the problems i faced with this headphonenot comfortable yes it is not comfortable my ear hurts after using them for like 12 hours they should have made foam more way betterfake battery promises they say the battery lasts more than 10 hours but it is a big lie my headphone battery works only for like 45 hoursheadphone turns off immediately on low battery this headphone does not alert a user before some time tha
very good product happy with its sound quality and look reason for 2 stars is that its heavy weight and its larger size makes me uncomfortable while using it and its very tight for my ears in fact i got pain in my ears while using it for 1 hour only for feeling comfortable i had to increase its size and that doesnt fit in my headthere is a second reason also that we cant carry it out of our home due to its larger lookproduct is good for home base use
i bought this specifically for gaming sound quality is not up to the mark cant distinguish between footsteps in games like pubg i have used boat earphones and trust me they are way better than this build quality is good but not for gaming as advertised
before buying i read many reviews everybody says its good dealbut its disappointe mesound quality not good i am use senhisser cx 180 earphone and its awesomeboat 510 sound not clear and after use some time pain in ear the problum in their design boat 600 design much better
no words to say an extra ordinary product pretty good sound quality and good looking also just go for it guys
awesome headphone in this price segment the sound quality is good for itself the design is cool and it looks like a gaming one as i am a gamer the packaging is good enough i got this product in its best price on big billion day with codthe only thing is that we can use this as a wired too thats pretty cool but when i use it for gaming purpose there is no mic for this i cannot talk with others i dont know why this but the product is awesome you guys can definitely go for it
the product is very good the noise cancellation is not that much good but i think u can still try it and most importantly u might write ther review after 10 to 15 days of usage i am also writing it ater 7 days and there is no problem till now the bass quality is very good and the design is badass in last it is worth to buy it thank you for reading this is worth to buy u can use for daily use and gaming
super headphones really loved it super bass very nice sound go for this headphones is best ever loved it nice build quality
i am giving my review after 1 month of purchase it is fabulous i ordered green color it was looking so much attractive the shiny look is brilliant for first week i did not even charge it i was surprised to see that its battery backup was great if you are willing to buy it just go and buy because in this range boat is on top special boat rockz models thank you
this review is based on my 10 days usage i brought this for playing pubg so far i didnt charge the headset still nw it has 50 remaining battery note while playing pubg i used aux for no latency coming to the build is good this is my first over year headset so i felt pain while using sound quality is good bass is good bt the voice clarity is slightly changed bt you cant notice that eitherone thing i didnt like while walking with headset on your head you can hear the sound of
everything in this price range is superb im using this for last 10 day everyday minimum for 2 hours even now it has 50 percent of battery superb battery backup and superb style
its a superb quality sound is so good but bass is little bit down moreover design is also nice overall this headphone is amazing i purchased it in 1299rs if anyone want to buy you can buy without any hesitation thanks alot flipkart
everything in this headphone are fabulous just love it and still im using it just one thing is that its little heavier when you use too long hours rest are good
awesome product i love it the sound quality is good and the bass is amazing its sound like a home theater
this product is very good it has very good sound quality i have used it for 3 years it hai uptil now best sound quality and very longer battery
very nice product surely buy this product love it awesome thanks flipkart for this product love it
its not comfortable because of its heavy design and not foldable you feel so much heavy its not flexible i will not recommend this product to any one comfort is the most important thing to listen and enjoy the music which you will not get in this product so i recommend everyone please purchase flexible and foldable earphones
best wireless headphones in this price segmentsound quality is excellent its battery is so powerful you can use it more than 20 hours if it is not charged you can use it like wired headphone
at the price range1099 it is beast sound quality is awesome bass is good and build quality is also noice for the first time you may feel it heavy but after 2 to 3 day of ussage you will get comfortable with it but still if you want more lighter product you can check another but it may cost you moreof boatoverall it is value for money
the best headset for gamers and this might give you pain on your ears for a few days but it will be alright if you use it properlythe bass is awesome as mentioned in its namein my opinion it is best to use it wireless while playing game like bgmi
i am giving a review after 7 months of use i loved it so much its battery bakup is super i use it for 2 to 3 hours a day i bought it in october 2021 and charged it for the first time it worked for almost two and a half months without being charged sound quality is also good
very nice headphoneits sound quality is superior bass is op i use it wirelessly with my laptop and believe me with some tuning in the audio software it gives the best audio experience of all the timei had been using a frontech headphone before this though it was very lighter than this its sound wasnt too good and its ear pads started to wear out very soonone thing i noticed disappointing in one of its side it feels no bass secondly its littlebit heavy its little bi
too good product this headphone boat rockerz 510 is too good this product is value for your money i would recommend this product for people who want headphones for listening music although the sound quality of this product is excellent but is audio jack is not so good nevertheless ive given it 4 stars because its bluetooth connectivity is better as compared to other bluetooth headphones and its sound quality is excellent at the beginning you would find some problems with its bluetoot

not comfortable over the head sound quality is not that much good that i expected and ear comforter is not good sometimes comming out and not fitting covering ear llp
my god better than expected dont explain by words im telling you the truth that this is the one only best headphones over the head i give my review after 15 days check all of its functions all are amazing the bass is vibrate all your ears the sound quality is crystal clear battery backup oh god just amazing the build up quality is dashing give you a handsome looktrust me dont read any review after this one this product is worth its price value for money
awesome product with productive bass and very good battery performancethe connectivity range is more than 10 mtrs sufficient enough for mehappy with the product would recommend everyone
i loved it very very nice product sound clarity is tooooo good
what a excellent blutooth device everyone must try it kids r happy with this device and it very useful for online classes in todays condition
this headphone is giving more battery backup than mentioned by company and no compromise by sound quality its bass can be little more but it can do your work in this price segment i can its the best head phone you can get but its not that comfortable after 4 hour your ears are started hurting
just amazing as expected this was my first ever wireless headphones from boat the reason i give it a 4 star rating is that i have to claim the warranty in 15 days but before i claimed the warranty it was just amazing you can wear it for the long period too its just perfect fitting of the cushion and the main highlight of this headphones is its bass and its 50 mm driver it gives you amazing sound quality you can buy it in sale for lesser price
worth every penny excellent heads phone crystal clear sound it will take you in other world if you r bass liker this set is made for you amazing battery backup over all just buy it and enjoy please remember you can not get quality of bose in 1500 bucks hence price wise it is best
its a headphone that i really searching for or i want sound quality is very nice and its design and colour touches my heart thank you boat and thank you flipkart
good nice and beautiful i like it my first head phone
product is good but in my case mic is not working i have tried in my mobile and laptop also but the mic is not working what should i do otherwise the headphone is good i have not charged my headphones from 2 months then also batteryis running i like the battery quality of this headphones and the bass sounds cool every thing is good but 1 thing i hated of this headphone that is mic problem i have fixed the drivers also of this headphones but then also the mic is not working so i will gi
i am using boat from past 16 years it is very nice product durability is very good but ear buds or sponge need to change after 2 years usage mechanically no damage or difference observed while using i am a daily usager with mobile and laptop and smart tv non stop i am using from past 2 years price is also good
product is super full bass is little less but can be fix with the help of equaliserbattery backup i purchase on 16 feb am use it for total 12 days 23 hrs per day usagesound sound is crystal clear every beat and instruments u can hearpubg half sound is sufficient for clear footstep pain in ear little pain sometimes i feel but not so much
i m reviewing it after using it for 6 months i used it everyday about 6hrs a daythe bettery life is still good sound is same it is good for those people who likes beatzzbass even soft songs are also gives good feelingusing it with aux is giving more clear audio i recommend it to buy this without waisting time it is best in this range
this is good product and the sound quality is good and gamers should use this with the urx wire because in gameing experience i feel that the foot steps are hearing me after 1s this is best for gamers but wire is very necessary in this situation and this is good for music and online classes and movies also
this is only for music lovers and call is optional it wont work after few days mine worked only for 1 week and im using this only for music it wont support for calling purpose mic wont work after few days
it is a very good product i used before boat 450in that sound loud 55 and clarity of vocals 375 and in this loudness 435 vocals 495 good headphones very comfortable compared to previous one used 3 hours per day and after 3 hours no pain but your ears will sweat best headphones under 2000rs
sound quality is good for its price range good built quality even call quality microphone is good i am using it with dual pairing with laptop for office meeting through skype and to hear music from mobile switching is there you cant hear both together i felt battery backup is quite good lasted more than 2 days almost 20hrs of intermittent use only drawback is not so comfortable for long hours max 3 hrs not because of continuous listening but ear started paining because of cusions
nice product amzing bass build quality is very nice over all nice product i love it
i will update the review after 1 monthfirst off all i want to say that its a great product super thumb bass bt actually that power we will get only by using bluetooth if we connected through wire there is some amount of soundloss and bass comparing with bluetooth connection the battery backup was really great i never get charged for 3 days bt it is still 90 its was really amazing i buy this product usually to play pubgits goodi had given only 4 stars because whe
the aux isnt too good i prefer using bluetooth with mobile since it gives better output bass is good according to price tag and noise cancellation is also satifactory design is really good looking and battery gives more time that company claims lol for my case atleast go for it
excellent battery backup good clear sound build quality is good at this price point not very rugged hence needs to be handled carefully these are initial impressions only long term update will follow only after 45 months of usage
for those who want bass dont purchase bass is not bad but is not super awesome sound quality is perfect very comfortable very nice design microphone is awesome battery backup is what i liked the most 2hrs of charging gives you 78 hrs of continous useoverall these are worth your money
battery backup is superb very good comfortability easy to wear good in looking
i loved the product amazing sound quality specially on bluetooth i have been using it for more than a year now only cons are1 after using it for an hour or so your ears my hurt because of the weight and build of this product2 i have been using it too much during the lockdown and the constant wear and remove action has peeled off its waterproofing plastic sheet from the headphone sponge so its no longer sweatproof3 its too big to wear and sleep if you like to sleep with your
after using it for a week i bought this to attend calls as started working from home charging was done only once in last week battery lasts for longsound clarity was awesome i had to do change some settings in laptop for micbluetooth is awesome only if you are on the straight path of your device otherwise there are disturbancesoverall good product to buy and am happy that flipkart delivered within 24hrs
hello everyone this is a awesome product for built and material quality sound quality is also good in most of the aspects but bass quality is not so good but it is good product to buy its over the ear and pads are very good and l could not feel of pain even wearing more than 2 hours continuously
giving reviews after using 15 days sound quality n bass is 5 out of 5best for gaming purpose built quality is reall good not as heavy as it looks noise cancellation in public is 4 out of 5consit pains a little after using it for half an hourwhen using the wire n answering a call ur voice cant react to the person at another side but while using bluetooth the problem is solvedits not good to carry while traveling bcoz its a little big if u ask me personally i would like to go

it is best for listening party songs but not for romantic songsit feels more tighter on ears after applying for 1 hour rest is best

it has good bass sound is well but no noise cancellation outside sounds are clearly heard no fm radio have aux connection port battery back up is ok zoook rocker ifit is great at 99900 with a drawback of low battery backup and no aux connection but have fm radio
i purchased it for 1399 on independence day salepros1passive voice cancellation i find it better than what i imagined2sound quality is upto the mark3bass is very good3battery backup is far better than they claim4 connectivity is goodcons1it is not that comfortable after using for 3 hours it causes pain i wish cushions would have been bit larger so that it can cover whole ear it actually rest on the ears which ultimately causes pain2design because of plastic

one of the best bluetooth headphones best quality sound and bass everything is just mindblowing best for gaming like for pubg mobile and pc
the product is good but it should have been lighter the biggest demerit is that the buttons volume pauseplay previous next doesnt work when playing with auxbut overall the product is good for this price rangei am satisfied
sound quality is superb bass is good too the audio cable is of bad quality you can hear the difference when it is connected to bluetooth and then using cable even though its first day i am experiencing pain in my left ear as i may have overused it 5hrs may be not quite used to it got it for 1399 super fast delivery within 18 hrs there is no better bluetooth wireless headphones at this price
as its review depicts bass quality of the headphone is good which i suppose to think it would have best but it is just satisfactory battery backup is splendid unbelievable superb whatever you may think so build is also good i love to use this
this is best headphone in this price range so farbass is too good that you can even experience a real bass woofer system with his headphonebattery backup is superb build quality is good a bit sporty look which makes it more cool awesome bluetooth connectivity just one thing is that there is a minimal sound leak but its fine when you have such a great sound and bass quality
good glossy design everything i love about it but at 80100 sound its audible clearly from outside
after i used it more then 15 days writing the review awesome battery back up up to 7 days after chargephenomenal design smooth clear sound quality value 4 money guaranteed

awesome sound quality best in class best in price amazing headphones for 1599
being a person who doesnt like very loud music it is absolutely perfect and i just loved the bass totally worth it for 1400 bucks if youre looking for bluetooth headphones go for it just one thing i felt that the aux cable is kind of cheap it keeps on getting disconnected while playing when aux is moved even slightly but on bluetooth it works flawlessly
the bass is awesome and earpads are comfortable i bought this one for gaming and its perfect for this purpose it has dynamic design and light weight giving you the confort if youre thinking about buying bt headphone ill recommend this one to you
i bought it for only pubg so many bluetooths are little bit slow 1 or 05 seconds when we playing pubg and mic didnt work properly but this one great for pubg and it will support 360 sound too i would strongly recommend for pubg lovers and gamers
after 3 days of use i can say its the best headphones you can get in this price range pros1 its sound quality is awesome 2 bass really is something on these headphones 3 battery life is best i have been using upto 3 days lightweight use and only 20 had drained 4 design is very cool its very modern now for the cons 1 the cups of these headphones are not very soft and will get uncomfortable after a long session 2 it has some latency will playing pubg but that can be solved by usin

a must buy product just love it super stylish design plus great audio and bass quality
the most amazing is that its battery is very good it is even more give backup than it says worth of money best headphone i have ever seen
the most recent of my buys from flipkart thanks for lightning fast delivery as promisedsimply the best decision i took when buying bluetooth headseti have been using bluetooth headset for almost few years now till now was using i ball which had clarity this time thought of trying boat rockerz 510 and one of the best decisions i madethe sound quality is absolute pleasure to hear and so is noise cancellation too didnt find any cons except that usb cable given is too short to plunge int
this is a very important review about this product1 the product dont work with wire2 the controls may not work properly specifically channel controlbefore buying know about sellers corseca wont replace the defective product theyll say u will be refunded time not specified cumbersome procedure sound is good with bluetooth if u dont want any controls to work if its just for sound like basic earphone u can buy this
let me explain you in detail from start to end the build quality no doubt in the prize which i bought just amazing the sound quality have 2 type of sound if you connected it with your phone then you will get very good sound with amazing bass and you will definitely love it but when you connect it with your computer through cable or bluetooth you will bit disappointed cause sound quality become weak but over all you will enjoy it battery 10hrs absolutely fantastic and enough for you
this is aon the ear headphone not over the ear headphone as shown in the specification highlights bass is awesome but it disturbs the vocalsso if u listen to music a lot this would helpbut watching movies and web series is not recommended using this producton the ear headphone makes head ache and pain in the outer earsbattery backup is awesome around 89 hrs also jack cable is available with this productnot recommended for long use but music lovers will find it amazing
this headphone is good but it realy disappointed me i am just telling my experiance over this headphone so its not mean that all these are correct i am lover of both music and games as a music loverevery one used to say that it has very great and extra puchu bass but it is not like that in fact boat rockerzz 400 and 225 s bass is far better than 510 it has only average level bass as a game lover there is sound lag while playing pubg by connecting it through bluetooth it really
after 3 months of use i am gonna list some pros and cons of this headphone pros are superb sound quality and bass awesome battery backup great design and control buttons plus wired mode which allows us to use it even when it is discharged cons are noise cancellation of the mice which is not that great and it also feels little heavy after long use
awsm headphones worth every penny super sound quality noise cancelation extra bass works fully it is an amazing product by boat battery backup is very good i have experienced it i ordered it in mid of may now also its battery is 70 design is also very cool i recommend to by the product it can connect with any device even iphones also thank you flipkart for giving discount on boat bluetooth headphones
cons 1 quality of the plastic used in the buttons on the side is not too good 2 sound clarity can be improved in my opinion it is the best wireless headphone under 2k
this headphone is super se ve upper and bass are amazing battery is very cool 55 yor show buy this headphone after1 day im order 1more boat rockerz 510 thanks flipkart
its a very good choice if you had bought it its gives very nice sound effects and very good valuable product it gives me realiastic experience with comfort
very nice headphone good for kids also value for money mic quality is best you should buy it thankyou
great headset the plus point is you can use it wireless and with wire in case of battery down not needed yet sound quality is good for listening music and in call super background noise removal overall good experience in firsy week use may review again sometime later
bass is great i would give it 5 out of 5 for bass and its pretty loud with some smartphones like realme or mi and not very loud with phone like oneplus 7t but sometimes there is distortion when its bluetooth is on and its battery i dont know why it goes from 90 to 70 percent and straight away from 70 percent to 30 percent and when it reaches 30 percent battery it beeps continuously after every 15 to 30 seconds when you listen music via aux there isnt much bass thats what i didnt like o

amazing sound quality bass all so very good batterys very very nice totally product awsome really love it
these are the best headphones you can get for the price nice sound quality awesome bass and very long battery life makes these headphones really good however there is a bit of lag so while playing games you may switch to wired connection as aux cable is provided in the box mic quality is a bit less while using wired connection but is sufficient
nice headphone with nice bass with good battery life 8 hours continue song play full valume i liked it this is value of money product
this headset is a good headset i had seen ever it works always properly any error have never happened this headset have a good battery backup and charge remains very long it gave a good bass effect and good sound quality it is the right choice for persons who love sounds and thank you boat rockers for such a wonderful thing
descent headphone with pretty good build quality i have been using rhis for nearly 20 days and with an average usage time of 1hr a day i have charged them only once they came with full charge in the pack so battery back up is out of this world sound and bass experience is descent for this price range if you want a headphone with a affordable price and descent performance it is a must buy one
so far i have used sony sennheiser and jbl i was a little bit apprehensive about boat however after using it for a couple of days i freely admit that i am impressed no one can tell the difference of sound quality between boat and other market giants the price is also very much on the lower side comparing the similar products marketed by other famous brands all the switches are very conveniently placed works for quite a long time after one full charge no unnecessary noise disturbance
i am very happy with all the products of the boat brand i have ordered this headphones for the second time and this is the best music lover gadget in the market at the moment
good product very good battery very good sound effects and very good look
every penny you spent on this bad boy is worth it u will feel a clear sound with soft vibrating bass which is crystal clear nd the mic also gives clear audio outputjust go for it i m sure u will love itignore negative reviews use it for urself u will know the differencei hope this review might help u so give a like if it helps uor dislike it this doesnt help u totally upon youthank you
so far so good but quality fantastic like primium bass and stereo fantastic
i have been using this headset for atleast 1 week now sound quality is absolutely awesome but it sounds even better with the aux connected it can also be used as gaming headset i am basically using the rockerz for gaming purpose it has 360 surround sound which is basic necessity for gaming but battery backup is the best thing in this headset i charged it yesterday for the 1st time on an average i am using it for 5 hours a big thumsup to boat for making such a beast like headsets
honestly i was very excited to get this product at first but now after using it for about a month ive come up with this review1 sound quality is not excellent for anyone who loves to listen to songs on earphones that have rubber tips with good isolation but these are fairly cheap headphones too2 the whole thing about the thumping bass is a gigantic hoax im not sure if it has bass at all3 battery backup is good enough to keep you going for a day with average usage4 sound se
awesome headphone bote is the good choice headphone great sound quality is very good and bass quality is great
this is the best product which i bought ever from flipkart its sound quality is the best and powerful bass after 100 charging its standby time is approximately 600 hrs and playback time is approximate 30 hrs during this period
good music quality decent bass decent battery backup looks great manageable comfort on ear overall worth the price i paid 1699
great product but was expecting lill more design n battery backup is good very clear sound blue tooth range is quite ok easy operation for egular gadget user first time user may face problem to operate as no instruction manual is there great buy 1499 thanks to big billion sale
i never heard so many beats and sounds from the same songs that i used to listen before the first time i put them on i was blown away by the astonishing quality of the voice crystal clear sound that differentiates itself by its richness bass is adequate and is at the sweet spot anything more than that normally blows away the richness of the song it is punchy and deep battery backup is insane i bought them on 30th of august and i am writing this review on 14th september they are stil
bass is awesomethe music is clearly touching earsjust dont thinkbuy it and it will satisfy you passive voice cancellation is also good outside noice cannot even be heard4 stars for this headphone and 1 star for flipkart diliveryawesome headphone
awesome headphones suberb sound with a good bass and clear music the ear cushions really very smooth which doesnt hurt your ears after long usageoverall satisfied with this product purchased at this price
well i am not used to writing reviews but i always wanted toi bought this product by viewing many review videos on youtube and also searched throughout the internetthis product is great if you go by bass due to bass enrichment i believe it is sort ofnot so noticeable low in a trebleif you love ear shattering bass then take it it is loud and heavybass
if u searching best bluetooth headphone i believe till now this is the best when price is concern and forget about battery backup sound bass its really decent but only one thing u need to remember its little bigger in size as compared to size but we can manage it its not like bit heavy product
sound is not loud my expectations were high because there were many positive reviews but i really dont like it there r many cheaper and better headphones in the marketsound quality 3 5 build quality 25
i receive today this awesome product but my ear get pain some time but ok quality of product is good and comfortable to use and awesome sound quality bass is really good
color is vary goodi like blue color so i recive blue color onlyvary nice producti like it thank u flipkart
it looks cool and very attracted design but not so comfortable to use it suitable for travelers and gamerscant use for ordinary routine person those who are always wear on headphones while you choosing headphones think wisely how long u gonna use it on daily basis and what is ur requirements which one meet ur requirements choose that if you doesnt you will regret like me
this device is not supporting on honor phones i have honor play phone and this device is not supporting 3d sound in game or music
except battery backup nothing greatto be honest it not worth for the amount i spenti recommend t go with some good product with little more bucks
the product is amazing and best part of product is its dual mode you can enjoy gaming in wired mode gives an amazing experience and you can also enjoy other stuffs like music call on wireless mode if its battery is low you can also try wired mode
product is really good its sound quality is also goodbass is good but not as good as neckband but more than average noise cancellation works on high sound like u r teleportedbattery backup is amazing really go fr it with second thoughtonly problem is when u stop song or anything for few time it get switch off quickly ig its inbuilt functionrest assured its value fr money
i had been using this as my daily driver for more than 1 year pros 1 loud sound quality above 50 others can hear your song clearly 2 good battery backup more than 20 hrs continue usage 3 stirdy build quality i had dropped more than 5 times cons1bass is not upto the mark2sound distortion above 80 volume 3 i also have mi superbass its far more superior than this if you are a bass lover go for mi superbass or you want loud music go for this
flipkart delivered a day earlier than the promised dateas for the headphone when i used it for the first time it already had 80 battery charged and using it for an hour a day after three days now it is 70sound quality is better than other headphones ive used until now boosted bass theatre effects are very keenly noticeddesign is great this is bigger than i expected it cupped my ears perfectly but using it more than an hour causes slight pain in the outer ear since it pressures th
trust me its not that much good as they claimed you wont feel extra bass ever sound is ok only boat rocker 400 is much better then this
value for money product i am using it from last 67 months i am so much impressed with it buying rockerz 510 is worth it in every scenerio whether it is bass build quality everything is nice at this range of money
it looks great and the finishing is perfect but i have an issue of ear pain after using of 2 hrs i get little of ear pain and the super bass is good and the sound is too good worthy of buying dont think off buy it
im a gadget reviewee and my review for this overhear headset are below 1 all are fine but u could feel pain in ur ears if you wear it for like 30 mins or more2 if ur into melody or pleasant music you will feel less satisfied3 perfect for gaming and best for high beat music4 performs better than bluetooth modewhen connected using aux cable5 best for watching movies as even the little minute sounds could be heared6 it gives a whole dynamic experience while watching movies and p
its a beasti cant say everything herebut believe me its far better than jbl alsoi used both product but as per my choice i can definitely say that its far better than jblthe bass is extra ordinary and theres no lag while playing pubgso also good for gaming purposebut the one thing which is good in jbl which is the comfort levelyaa its not that much comfortable but yaa for 23 hours of usage there will be no issuesgo for it
review after 6 months works great soun quality is best battery backup is good but buttons are not syncing perfectly with my phone and exact amount of battery remaining is not showing it could be problem of my phone
i have been using sonys xb450 wired headset since 5 years believe me this does not come remotely close to the crisp and clear sound quality of sony i wont say its bad but dont expect too much from this device at this price its average product one i shall keep using as a backup i amgoing for another sony xb450
sound quality is very good at low volumes but not good at higher volumebass is goodissues while talking on calls our voice doesnt go clear and also less audibleoverall a good headphone but sound quality can be improved
i bought it after seeing many youtube reviews and also customer reviews so i bought it i was barely just satisfied with the sound quality as the people said the sound quality doesnt reach ur expectations but the bass is fabulous u wont expect the bass to be that loud the built quality is also good enough and battery backup is sufficient the studio and looks are great so i wont suggest u these headphones but these are good
it is a good product but its locks of earcups become loos in a few day bass is normal but as per specifications it extra bassuff it flash the earcups too heavyweight my ears are painting battery back up is good sound quality is good the filip kart not ready take any responsibility they are suggested to call sellers ufff it not good for any responsible company
best sound quality in this range bass ls little low but its ok design is very good cool looks best part is its battery backup
the best headphones with this much specifications its actual price on the box ie 4000 rs but you are getting such a beast at 2000 rs only first the good things about it1 great battery backup2 good quality build 3 great sound4 good looksthe bad things about it1 while connected to bluetooth some low cracking voices occur but they are very low and while playing games like pubg and codm etc the sound of firing with ads comes a bit latebut overall im satisfied with this purchase
excellent performance good stylish and comfortable to use good sound quality
been using for 3 year and it is good but aux cable and usb cable coming with the head set is trash both stopped working after one month but i liked headset really after one year there are some wear and tear and working fine if u are looking for a simple headset go for it
its just wow what a bettry backup sound bass m so happy thank you flipkart for such a wonderful product
the product is good at its price but as the said extra powerful bass that bass is not so as they said also my ears sweat a lot after wearing it but yeah good battery backup is good also the mic performs very well
i loved this product a lot i have been using it for 2 years now and till now it works perfectly fine
i like this headphones i am using this last 2 day and i have no problem with it but sometimes you should know before buy it pros great bass if u love bass then go for it battery backup is excellent i am using this headphones last two days without changing and still its battery is 70 so battery backup is awesome look style but cheepercons build quality is not more great its feel cheeper sounds quality should be more clear but its good if u are carrying headphone in bag so dont
its nice and good i like it but not fast delivery from next time onwards please send fast delivery ok
best headphones for that person who loves base and headphons vocals are also very nice but button are made full of plastic which can be broken but quality is good and cushions ar so good its give nice comfort this is the best headphones under 2000
great set of headphones bass is good vocals are clear too but dont play at full volume as the vocals start getting affected best thing is you also get a wire to make your wireless headphone a wired one if you feel like overall a good product at the price point
i am using this product form around more than 1year 6 months it is worth it and best quality working as same as day one best quality
good product i like this product but size is littile big but it is comfortable to wear i wear this earphone 45 hours my ears are not paining you can buy this product with closed eyes it is also good for gaming also
truly great purchase sound quality is excellent bass is just to good i feel this product will be easily placed among the best in the industry sony one of the best things again is the battery lifethis is an excellent option at this price guys just go for it
this headphone is best headphone at this range its sound quality is very good with fantastic bass i recommend you to buy it
it is a very good producti like this headphoneit is a very bright colourredsound quality is goodcharging time2hrsi am enjoying to use this product
its a good product and it has the worth for the money u invest it has the amazing build quality and the battery back up is awesome nearly 10 hours if we use continuously the bass of the song is little bit low the bass quality disappointed me but other than its an amazing product i faced little bit disturbing when the its connects to wired the quality of the audio jack it very poor it has to be improved its feels very comfortable when it is wore t
loved this productmy brand always boat one of the ultimate quality of soundeven sony also not give these experiencesguys go a head with this product worth for a single penny finally got awesome life partner
superb headphones with extra bass and comfort i suggest to buy boat rockerz 510 these are very good in style audio etc these are comparatively better than any other
this is good but only connected to to phone in headphone jackbut connected to bluetooth its not giving a expected soundsound is good but not for gaming like free fire
its a brilliant headphone best sound quality bass features but from one thing from which i am disappointed that it doesnt fit properly in my ears the ear cushion should be a little bigger but at all its very good
just awesome using this for some time now its the best one at this price compared to other headphones awesome looks and build only thing is its a little heavy but a great one must buy
this is a superb product for this price range it really feels worth every penny perhaps even more p the sound quality build and battery life is quite impressiveheres one satisfied customer
light weight good connectivity with phones good sound quality very comfortable can wear 5 to 8 hours and money valuable
writing this review after 20 days of usage looking for budget headphones then go for it these are the best headphones in the market sound quality is awesome battery backup is too good comfort is also fine as they provide soft earcups they also provide an aux cord and a charging cable satisfied with the product and also by the fast delivery of flipkart
it says it has mic but it doesnt work at all its not good for call but good for music another problem i face is i feel so hot on my ears so cant use in summers though its good for winter
highly recomended if your budget is less tha 2k i have been using it since 15 years now no issues with the sound but the ear cushions have started to wear out may be because of the rough use i did if you love to listen music or you like to play games like pubg csgo valorant etc you can buy this but keep in mind wired connection of this headphone gives better output than bluetooththis product is good for music production
vary good product and fast service thank you flipkart for best offerce
its a good headphone and its super extra bass for gaming its very good thank you flipkart
i love this headphone as its just perfect at this price its battery backup is very good and bass is so good
yeah boat rockerz 510 is a very good head set but the sound is coming out the battery backup and bass is awesome the design is perfect for music lovers
havent really used it much but its classy its just a little loose on the head and im not confident working out wearing it which is the reason why i bought it if you want to buy it go ahead its a good one but would like to workout in a gym wearing this i wont recommend this
great battery life compared to 400 crystal clear audio and sturdy looking best headphone in this price range
boat rockerz 510 if you want a good budget headphone with perfect mic system and specialised for pubg and cod also extra bass gives a home theater like experience also the built is superb a super extra bass give a great experience also good for gym
i have been using this headphone for more than 2 weeks and i found it amazing though it has some flaws well its inevitable and i got it for rs 2000which is just okaylook feel and built qualitythe look is stunning and attractive i bought the blue one strong etc the headband is mainly comprised of plastic with some aluminum plate which makes it lighter for an overthe ear headphone and is comfortable with the cushion on top of the headband the things is its amazing i
just superb sound quality and very comfortable to wear mic is also very good feels like i am not even making an effort to speak and also has noise cancellation and also looks super cool overall go for it
best one i am so happy with my boat sound quality and battery back up is upto the expectations must recommend to everyone
very good product worth every penny thrice good bass good battery backup fast connectivity love it only one disadvantage difficult to carry
best product i recommend this product its bass was very cool and amazing
its an awesome product worth the money you spend on this i have been using it for two months and i love it the battery backup is the best amazing design and overall a very good package if anyone searching for headphones this is the product
its a good product there is a bit latency if you play games you have to use the aux cable but the aux cable they provided with the headphones are not of good quality mine stopped working after 3 weeks and the charging cable they sent is also not that good but headphones are really good for this price range
very nice product extremely satisfyingbass is mind blowing ears starts paining after using it for sometime and others can listen sound at full volume design and build quality is good vocals are much cleaner than other headphones even at high sound well i assure you that youll not be dissatisfied after purchasing it
writing this review after 2 months and im glad that i have purchased this product i have seen all the parts of harry potter played free fire for more than 2 3 weeks in just one time charge and till i have charged it only one time and since it is going on its design is adorable sound quality bass is incredible enjoying after purchasing this product
super head set in world sound and bass is very good and battery backup is very good over all its a very good headset in the world
great experience battery backup is excellent just keeps running not very good at sound quality but not bad also i would say its above average and one of the best at this price range the features are great one secret usewhen connected by bluetooth if you double press the multifunction button it calls on your last call no try thispackaging was really greathope it helped
wellthe reason behind giving 3 star was simple1 your experience may not be good as it seems to be because if you play game like pubg cod etc then there is a delay in the sound retrieving or in other there is a sound delaywhich i think is not desirable from my point of view as a gamerwireless experience was bad in my casebutif you are using wire then it provides delightful output something awesome though2 design what i mean is that whenever i put it on
the boat print on top after a week of use started to fade rest all fine works like a baby and initially the ears hurt cause the cushions arent adjusted to the likes of your ears i can normally go on for like 12 hours with this without any pain on meh ears recommended to all
excellent battery charges very fast and the comfort is awesome bought it at rs 1764 and worth it
after 1 month i give my opinion for this product bass is superb i love it if u also love from bass then you can buy and battery backup is also very good
blue colour as shown in imagei m writing this review after 3 months of useits really good in sound bass is superb battery backup is good value for money sturdy n cool overall best buy
very good productnice sound quality and bassbut the aux cable provided with this is very bad the output is not good and it stop working after 2 months even though i am a careful userthis is also ideal for gaming
this is totaly beast in value for money and its also quit good sound quality when you are in gaming vocals are clear when you have out of battry so mention not it has audio jack to connect this is really cool and not worry about battry its almost have 6hr of backup and also this fit in your head easily its cover whole ears and also feel hot and not longer comfertablebass not much as haevy as expected but its goodmustbuyhappyshopping
i am going to give the honest reviewas talking about the bass it best quality and i will rate 55then comes to the design is aloso goodand battery backup is wonderfulbut but but there is a problemwhen you use it for more time then your ear gona painbut after using the headphone you will get used to it there is a minor problem or we can se advance feature that it connects to to product at the same time and the other person who is watching something and the soung will come in your hea
best of this price with normal using and not clear sound produce only okok type products im not facing any problemsbut some issues on comfort level which will not fitting on our ears their ear cups are very small which os not suitable for men or adults only kids are wearing this headset very well
battry is toooo much good u dont hv to charge for 1012 days bass is just boom boom awesome
these headphones are very good excellent sound quality best bass in this price its worth all the money battery life is also very good and is very comfortable they look very stylish i m completely satisfied with this product edit i have been using this product for last two days and havent charged it even once really really impressed with battery life
sound is super but quality of sound is not that super bass is ok clarity is good design was awesome boat 900 headphones are good bass better than this with aux cable sound is worst with bluetooth it is good
at first experience you may not find its the best product but using it over and over you will begin to love the sound outputbattery backup is awesome overall it is a nice product
pros well tuned sound output both bt and 35 mm jack work well mic decently priced soft cushioningcons sony or panasonic users may find bass towards the lesser side
awsome product i purchased this for gaming and i use it regularly battery is awsome like 5 to 7 days also pubg lover should buy this boat awsome
very nice beautiful good product very valuable price very good i happy
modest headphone nowhere near sony though sound quality ok at best bass is modest not extra anything normal at best build quality good battery back up and microphone is pretty good i use it for listening to online classes so it is suitable for me one annoying thing is sound isolation is absolutely zero anyone sitting as much as a feet away can listen to what you are listening i also have sony wired headphone ant it is much more comfortable have better sound quality and the best thin
sound is good bass is not too good its just ok battery oh my god doesnt seem to be discharged i am wondering i am using it for 9days for 2 to 3 hour and steel half battery left boat rockers 400 has better bass
good for you and the truth about it and easy access to the mobile phone good sounds like this earphones
im writing this review after 2 months of purchasing this product and this headset is just lit af it has remarkable bass beautiful design a little bit of cheap plastic is used but that is negotiable the sound quality is awesome and its battery backup is just unbelievable a must buy product if you are looking for a headset to buy
its a detailed review of continious 6 day use if youre into a bassy and decent quality headphones its a very good choicethe battery is a beast charges very fasta nd battery backup is upto 3 days nearly although the bass is a bit uncomfortable at first but it will fit with your head size within a few days the sound is very nice and clear no cluttering and giggling while operationits one of the best headphones under 2k
top class headphone battery life is excellentsound quality is nice clear and bass is very good
my one requestplz to all buyersplz dont review anyproduct specially this on that day when it delivered toyour homeplzz review after 1015 daysim sure your 34 star willconvert into 5 starbcoz in first day it will look bulky nd big but after using some days it will look light weightnd normal size nd also its sound quality will seem moreawsmi m in love with my rockerz 510 im writing this after15 days usage nd now my ears are not paining even 23hours continue usagethis
to be honest its a great product i havent thought that its battery juice would run almost for a week coz im a heavy user awesome battery backup guys trust me n specially recommended for those bass lover coz while playing bass boosted song this thing gonna shake your ears up
one of the best purchase i had with flipkart value for money product elegant design superb sound quality nicely built trendy and stylish super fast delivery from flipkart power back is same as described no issues till now if any one looking for a bluetooth headset then this is very great option go for it guys without any second thoughts
perfect delivery boy is very good nice product osm fabulous thank you flipkart
first of all buy this product during sale time you will get it at a price of 1299second the product is good but the sound quality is not up to the mark u can get better sound quality from boat wired earphone which cost 450 when you wear the headphone after 30 min you have to remove it for 23 min for getting relief from pain in earsit is very light weight but look very bigthe battery backup is excellent last more than 11 hr if you use it in medium level sound
it produces a good sound and specially its thumping bass is mind blowing design looks cool and gives some kinda gamer look battery backup is mind blowing ox cable given in box is also of good quality and good length but there are a few negative points ie its not comfortable if u wear it for an hour u will notice pain in ur ears due to its on the ear design and not so soft leather music comes out and it might disturb someone nearby but its a good deal at 1299 loved it you know
budget headphone its having good battery backup with low bass effect in aspects of design and quality is bit impressive one thing is vey less bass leads to put down overall its good to buy and use for normal purpose rather than musical
very nice u gonna love d product go for it nice battery backup superb bass and very good quality product
very nice product good voice battery backup is so good so i think its nice device to me
its a good product by boatand it has a very good battery backupgives an awesome look with extra cushion in it totally a worthy cool productbut the only problem with it is that it gives a mild ear ache when used for more than 4 min
excellent product with very good battery backup no desync issues while playing media not recommended for pubg players since this is a bass boosted headset you may not capture proper sound while gaming and the only thing you could hear would be those of bullets passing by
if you want one in budget and awsome sound good build quality dont wait go for it its a bit heavy size is little too big but its awesome in its duty sound quality battery backup and bass
best bass in this price segment better than jbl battry backup is superb no problem in connectivity very comfortable after using 4 5 hours regularly in online classes no pain in ears buy without any hesitation best product from boat
nice product in effective price for music lovers and pro gamers bass is very effective and also supported in ios ipod and in android also best headphones
its a very awesome product and it has very good bass and the best part is it has both wire and bluetooth options so its a must buy headphones it
awesome product pros1 very big battery life can last upto 10hrs or more of listening on a single charge2 very nice sound quality very good bass3 sound cancellation is excellent4 can be used both on bluetooth and aux no charging required when using on aux5 call quality is excellent6 fits perfectly can be used when joggingcons1 very big design therefore feels big on ear cannot be used when on bed2 is not foldable so requires care when keeping it you need to kee
great product and amazing sound quality as well good bettry product
i have been using this headphone for 6 months it is nice headphone sound quality is nice but bass can be improved built quality is good but it is not foldable carrying a headphone which is not foldable is headache and last not least its battery backup is awesome approx 3 to 4 days lasting
ok let me put in this way though i m not a music lover but still for gymming purpose i bought this connection strength is superb battery backup awesome eight nine hours easily it will give in one charge then bass is too good only the reason to give one less star is this is little heavy and could be foldable design so that it would be easy to carry
great headphones great bass amazing ones for music battery backup is awesomea must buy thingi bought it for 1499 on a single day sale
good one nice in sound and base i had aa good experience in traveling and long lasting batteryl pick up good one thank u
just awesome best for listings best for gaming like pubg if u r a gamer just go for it
only good for home use not recommended for long use it causes pain in ears rest siund quality and bass is good but are not comfortable to use
overall great headphone with good sound and great bass along with decent battery standby but seemed bit heavy recommended to buy
its a good headphone in budget and very light weight with decent audio quality the only down point is that it is not comfortable with ears so if you are looking for comfort than i would not recommend it otherwise it a good purchase
good for gamers and for watching movies there is a little bit of audio leakage even though the phone has inbuilt mic its not suitable for phone callsit makes music listening an enjoyable experience lasts for more than four hours after being charged for 15 hours
awesome and nice product bass is too good sound is also fine
extreme next level bluetooth headphones its really awesome i recommend to everyone who are bass lovers i love this headphones thank you flipkart for one of the best product in my list
the best there is there there ever will be what a fantastic bluetooth headset u can never use a bluetooth continuously for 24hrs but even if u use it for 5hrs it will give more than 3 days backupexcellent and fantastic battery up it only takes 2hrs for full charge but it has more than 3 days battery life after full charge do go for itbattery backup 5 design 5 bass 5 sound quality 5

as mentioned battery is superb bass is awesome sound is bit very high ear starts paining after sometime bass lover can go for it worth to money
i got my product today with seal open box then i have some doubt about my product quality sound was superb bit it look like used headphone with some type of miner scratch on itother wise the product looks cool and awesome

sound quality is ok for me 0710bass is awesome 0810 you can feel vibration battery also good 0810size feels big 0610build quality 0810connectivity good 0810overall good product in this price
its power backup is so amazing it lasts for more than 10 hours i just charge it for maximum one hour and use it up to 15 days and its sound quality is also amazing its bluetooth connection is so strong and its so stylish and it gives a lot of bass
best product at budget price ear cushions quality is is impressive and it will make you feel quite comfortable while using overall build quality and design of product is attractive though keys they provided on right side of headphone gives you more plastic feelit could be better talking about extra bass they mentioned it is actually there belive me the quality of sound will make you ignore all other headphones you have it is epic also it has strong battery backup go for it
really good base and the clarity is really good for this price i was so skeptical about buying this product but after reading all the reviews im glad i got it the mic is not up to the mark though youll have to scream a bit to alk but i mainly use it for the audio so all cool

guys hello myself amit i will giving you a detailed review of using this device after using 2weeks first of all if you are sreacing this for bass then its not made for u1 excellent vocals and crystal clear sound2 but you will not get high sound like his lower version 4003 this is not foldable and easy to carry4 design is very good and morden looks 5 built quality is average atlast you are a bass lover and pc gamer or using high volume songs then its not for u if you are like me
awesome mediocre bluetooth range superb battery 1010 a lil big but great in isolating noise inbuilt microphone great build quality good enough for gamingyes can play pubg n cod feels good n comfy
nice product good bass and sound quality good battery backup but its a bit bigger in size and doesnt look much stylish on your head too much volume and the sound travels out
super sound quality especially bass is awesome very nice for movies and hearing songs worth for money

purchased this product for the 2nd time now from flipkart this time to gift it to my brother i ordered on 23rd oct n was delivered on 24th oct just 1 day awesome quality of product is great considering the amount paid great for home use n voice clarity is nice while receiving calls overall value for money
awesome product especially bass is a superb smooth and clear sounds better voice quality than apple ear phones value for money go for it
my feedback as on today1 sound quality is good as is the bass decent noise blocking as this is passive one2 fit is okay but its neither its lightweight nor that comfortable for long use both on ear and head in spite of the decent cushioning foams 3 connection sometimes takes a while to set up with new devices4 duel mode is beneficial if you run out of charge its a great feature5 decent standby and running timesoverall the product is decent and it looks worth the mon
awesome product receivedvery nice sound quality and fantastic bassmust buy itvery nice at this pricetrrific purchase made
fantastic producti am very happy and it is as it is shown in the image by flipcartsound quality and calling quality is outstandingi must say its a worthy product
good product at a affordable price rs 1299the best price ever for this product everything is good battery backupdesign sound quality bass buttons but the battery indicator is not showing the exact power remaining in the headphones all in all a good purchase
one of the best budget friendly headphone highly recommended to all who want good quality headphones stylish awesome soundquality under 5k
8 months with this headphone and man are they are fabuloussound quality best under 1500 bucksbass is good but not greatbattery is a monstertrust me i have to charge this thing at alternate monthsbuild quality couldve been betterpersonally i never tried them with aux cablerange is good it doesnt get disconnected after a few metres but the music starts to lagall in all these are the best ones you can get under 1500 bucks so you shouldnt even think twice to consider these headpho
everything as per the price range is satisfactory except for the cushioning that has been provided it has been observed the cushioning provided gets degraded over time also no extra ear or head cushions provided for future wear and tear quality and built is good and sound is amazing at the given price range should definitely include at least 1 extra pair of haed and ear cushions
im a music lover whatever i choose related to music i will go for the best i have gone through research on various headphones but im stuck at boat rockers 510 which has the best stylish look and great sound system with deep bassabove i have mentioned that this is the best headphones yes this is the best headphones at this price range if anyone wants to buy headphones i will refer boat rockers 510 and after buying this u will also do the samebuy this and enjoy best sounds
its an excellent product with best sound quality and with excellent bass its a best headphone at this range of pricethank you boat for best headphone
worth for 2kbest part is it work thru bluetooth and thru connection line also boss effect is good and very important the battery backup amazing go for it im using it for some time good one
product as usual like my earlier boat rockers 400 headset its sound clarity is amzinghigh bassgood build quality and shocking battery back up i got 9 days battery i am using it daily high bassvery stylish and premium looking if u wear it u will look like a radio jockey or dj mixerbut little heavy and not foldable ideal for home or work use not that ideal for travelling time because its little heavy by size but weigh less and not foldableworth and value for money got it for 1299 on o
these headphones are really good in such a price the sound quality is clear and crisp and the bass is really good the bass is not way too much but it feels enough its build quality is very good and has excellent quality plastic the headphones fit perfectly and give an immersive experience overall these headphones are awesome in such a price i would very strongly recommend to buy this

price point of view its very good n nice sound but the problem is volume comes out and entire world can hear that and cant hear for more than an hour for me its just a back up so its worth for the price battery backup is really really nicegive it a try
battery backup is excellent am getting 15 to 16 hours of backup bass is thumping ear vibrates in full volume affordable and best sound quality is best in this range
i had gifted it to my neice and he loved it his other friends also liked it
bought during the big billion day pros1 sound quality is very good bass is optimal2 buttons are well built and works fine while controlling music or calls3 the ear cushions are soft and comfortable4 battery backup is also goodcons1 the headphones feel a bit too tight around the ears i think in due course it will expand and get adjusted but in a first usage its feel a bit tight2 while talking during calls one needs to speak loudly to get picked up by the mic i t

this product is way better than i thought the designs are cool and connectivity is also good and crystal clear sound etc this product is better than i expected

sound quality awesome and best quality above average and design better and battery backup is also good i really like this headphone
really worth for money the bass effect is awesome and the battery back up is also fine if you looking to buy this dont have second thought just go it immediately
great sound quality good noise cancellationhigh bass especially in max volume i cant listen to it in max volume for too long low sound leakage only problem is that it is not comfortable i can listen 2230 hour max maybe because i had a on the headphone thats why this one is a little uncomfortable for me i recommend you to buy it if you do not intend to wear it 45 hrs in one sit otherwise try rockerz 600on the ear they are really comfortable for me battery backup for both headph
better than i expected nice product it also contains the aux cable which is also very good again a good product by flipkart
thorough bluetooth connectivity the audio play quality is awesome but through earphone its just like any other basic headphonesbut overall build quality is awesome sound is very good through bluetooth and via aux its just little better than regular
bass is so awesome that there is nothing much to say just go for itsounds are also very clear it makes u feel like u are really in to itbattery is also good and there is the design which u can see from just design u will probably think its cost would be like 7k or 10k caz design is
best headphones to buy under 2000 best voice quality and a powerful bass system which is very much enjoying while listening songs best headphones to buy
super battry backup i got this on 6 august and still i dont have charged it and i had used it lots of time and battry is still 50 sound quality is good bass is good for bass lover but not for someone who like super bass i got it for 1600 also it drop to price of 1300 in big billion day so wait for the sale best for this price range updated review after one year stil working very good even with very harsh care of this very durable believe me i have used so much very goog battry backup s
writing this after 6 months of use it is still good as it camei still get 78 hours of battery backup in this range this is the best boat has to offer i thinkone of my lovely feature is dual compatibility with bluetooth and 35mm jacksound and bass quality no complaints
its so better with wire connection compare with bluetooth really with aux connection really awesome treble and bass are so good in that its definitely worthy no doubt at all
it is one of the best headphone i ever used superb sound quality have it if you have dream of listening good music the best part of this headphone is that it do not give headache even if u listen for hours in full volume loved it
first of all the sound quality bestest the bass quality bestest design build childish or gamer type but better battery backup upto 10 hrs isnt it sufficient and last but not least comfortability bro first use it 23 days and it get comfortable very fast and in this range it is an best product worth buying it review boat rockerz 510 499 001 for such childish design but although it is great headphone
awesome headphone at this price i bought it for 1299 and it really worth the money looks like big but light weight with smooth cushions
the product is good but the delivery was not good so far concerned boat has really worked hard on bass and the build quality is also good a good headphone in a suitable budget
amazing product just loving itbass is super greatsound quality is awesomedesign and build is dashing totally loving this headphonesamazing product from boat everyone should try these headphones
dis is a very good and very different product to other i like it dis is best bluetooth headphone in under 2000 and is fabulous
blindly purchase this product this is fully loaded with features it is very reliable for use he looks bold but whenever i used he feel like premium and lightweight most of all the sound clarity is superb
mind blowing purchase very easy to use great sound bass is good and battery backup is good overall package is excellent
this is one of the best headphones in thisprice range dont even think once just get this foryourself im totally impressed with boat ive bought around 4 products and all are truly amazing thank you boat
nice sound quality for music and gaming
its a super bass headphonei strongly recommend this to everyone whos seeking for low budget headphonesbut only demerit is after using for several hours i feels some sort of earpain which is because of small earcups i thinkits the only problembut coming to sound quality and battery backup its the best low budget headphone
a good product for price good thumping bass surround sound effect makes you feel comfortable and enjoy music even at high volumes keeping the noise to the minimum an excellent product for that price totally worth the purchase
i like the design very much great look quality of sound is very sharp its excellentbass is too goodvery much satisfied with this purchase highly recommend for music lover
its wonderful but its very big i mean if you would carry you should have bag with you but its good if are at home at night you can enjoy your music and its hard too for your ear but as per sound quality nd battery backup its fantastic
though its very good and a awesome product but sometimes it feels like it disturbs the originality of the sound its best for listening bass boosted songs
wow i dint expect it is such a good product until i experience its really amazing headphone and definitely value for the money if you are planning to buy this then dont even think for a second thought just go blindly
best headphone i have ever used killer bass good sound quality and connectivity best for playing pubg just loved it one more amazing thing is its battery backup just believe me i am using it since 5 days daily at average of 56 hours and till now its 60 percent charged
wow its really a great headset and bass and 8d sounds are very amazing in this boat rockerz 510 and who wants gaming headset and good bass headset for music so go for it and who wants gaming headset for pubg and call of duty so this headset was greatly working for gaming really its a great product by boat i love it alot and thanks alot to flipkart for good delivery and thanks to boat for great product with fairy price
this headphones was a good sound quality and the bass was high level and is design is nice because the colour finesh is so good like glossary finesh

awesome sound but little bit heavy robust construction perfect fit nothing can be found like this at such price i got it for only 1169 during bbd sale
super product super bass awesome boat its like wearing woofers on my ears
this is my honest review i purchased this before 15 days i used daily 5 hours but i charged the beast only 3 times the battery backup is like a himalaya but little bit pain in ears when i hearing sound in it i feel i was in movie theatre the android devices doesnt shows the battery percentage but ios showing the battery percentage i can connect over 4 devices at the same time finally the one word is i love it
i have purchase this product at rs 1170 during bbd i must say that headphone has superb built quality sound is clear with decent bass i would say that it is a good product in its segment headphones
this headphone is very fabulous there bass very strong this headphone sound is clear and there price is proper the quality of headphone is best buy this headphone there is no mistake it will give fast delivery there is no delay of product
a great traveling companion battery life is yet to be juiced out but seems good as of now played 6 hours at 70 battery not for the audiophile bass is satisfactory person sitting beside can clearly listen to what you are playing built quality is good with tactile button response looks are sure stylish all in all a good wireless headphone from boat trivia billionaire sachin bansal has invested rs20 crore in boat
value for money1 bass is better2 vocals are clear 3 comfort level is not good it started causing pain to my ears after 30min of usage 4 after all best under 1500 final verdict best buy under 1500 but remember it is not must buy
very high rated product in this price range very well sound quality bass is not that super extra as per tagline comfortable spectacular design the bad side is it is non foldable
nice superb sufficient and enough to take highin good time
size is very huge bass is very good but echo is also very much so there is no perfect sound engineering but yes you be on call by putting this headphone it has nice connectivity of bluetooth as well
best headphone in this range design is very attractive battery is awesome atleast 10 hrsi am using this from atleast 2 months and now also it looks like new i recommend you to buy it very loud voice with extra bass when you play a song in it you fells that you are standing in front of many big speakers
really good output from these headphones 1totally covers ears2comfortable 3design is lit4best part about it is i literally felt vibration near my ears while playing games and watching movies like hole music system is near me its kinda dope5on the other side its bulky and people near seating around me can actually heard headphones voice while listening at hight volume but it doesnt matter a lot i guess 6overall best headphone till date you can give a try its worth it
its been a year im using it i like the way it works but the battery indicator didnt working my mobile its gets tuns off even the indicator shows 50 is halffull be side of that every thing works great till now
battery backup owsome using since one week and still its at 50 good smooth audio quality like sony design owsome and perfectly fit no pain over earcons dont go for this if you are bass lover like me jbl is best in that bass quality too poor
nice product value for money fanatic sound effect and bass but little bit need improvement in build quality nice package and design actually i dont have no more words to praise thanks to boat
i am using this product from last one month in starting i fill it a little heavier than another products but now i am used to it and find it very comfortable ear cups are of free size and fit for small large and medium sized overall it is a good purchase in this price segmenteven on youtube it is working fine but playing pubg and other games leaving time is 1 to 2 seconds
i just loved it the best part is battery works up to one week some time as i use it 2 hrs daily
you will be lost in this amazing music world moreover the battery is semiinfinitetakes long time to drain which is goodthis headphones helped me to relieve from the exam stress thank you boat for this wonderful headphones
osm headphones good quality plastic material is used bass is super cool you just love it
after 2 month of purchase this headphonei reviewed about this amazing product at first i didnt like this headphone because of its size and thought its have low build quality but after using this headphone regularly i just love this headphone i prefer this for watching movies for bass lovers its heavenalso sounds good tooall vocals sound nice
sound quality is good and bass is nice battery backup is awsome and tremendous me an average user 2 3 hr d getting a month usage of single charge thts really awesome
excellent base very good battery nice and clear sound in this price u cant expect anything more really a grt product by boat lots of appreciation
very good and solid build and battery is awesome sound quality is super
more than happy with its performance n its really comfortable noise cancellation is ok okoverall i m happy with ittotal value for moneygot it for 1250 bucks
got this headset 34 days late writing this review after a month totally worth the wait superb bass amazing battery life i play pubg battery lasts fr 3days u can make out enemy footstep directions different sound tho it says on the box 10hrs u gt more n more battery best budget headset i ever had
best sound quality n awesome bass love it highly recommend for music lovers
battery back up is not as much as shown and sometime mike doesnt work while playing game but it looks stylish bass and sound quality is good and for listening music its excellent
awesome value for money product specially since i got it on offer but its still worth 2k id saybass is the biggest plus point on this but you need good quality music other than that only the glossy part would be better with matte finish and it weighs more than the average headphone
i am i bought this headphonepros1 awesome battery backup2 excellent connectivity range3 cushion is very nice4 wired connectivy gives even better performancecons1size is too big so i dont use it outside i use it only at home when playing pubg2 battery percentage is never accurate mostly shows 70 battery left3 wireless experience is great for listening dj songs or 8d songs but not that great to listen romantic songs like arijit singhs music
superb and attractive item i like it so much i dont have any words to say go for it rit now friends
the headphones indeed are one of the best in the price range the bass is good and battery power is really cool
i am in love with this headphone sound quality top notch build quality could be mote better but its not a big deal if we see price then its justified you can bilndly go for it
just good i buy for gaming use mostly for pubg bt little bit delay in sound and i will say wired headphones are the best for perfect audio quality its good if you just want listen songs not for pubg
it is a very good looking product and you can feel that the plastic and the built look very premium but i dont feel there is any extra bass in that the sound quality is ok but nothing impressive but the money what you are paying you are getting a excellent product
it is used as two in one purpose like use it as bluetooth head set and also as a wired headset the base and sound clarity is awesome best for music and movie lovers
such a wonderful product amazing basssssss and clarity worth of 17k really superb battery backup is so good still i saw 5 movies and heard 100 plus songs battery still 90 i didnt charge since buy the product
for those who are bass lovers please ensure your mobile specifications once for some smart phones the bass in these headphones are not up to the mark so you can always apply the changes in audio settings and increase the bass quality as of for me its just awesome the battery life is way beyond expectation its been 4 days since i purchased it literally awesome go for it the bass quality is damn good
absolutely awsome product when the design was awsome and sound quality such a nice i like this headphone at low price
the headphone have awesome built quality with vision even on the top it has good battery life and fell premium and i also like the colour combination of black and green which boat have introduced

i purchase this on 28 july and after 2 weeks i see the result that its a very nice headphone its good to listen music but i recommend not to go with this if u r pubg lover as it is not as loud as i expected
best ever in my life this made a clear bass sound light weight quality overall excellent best boat 510 really iam impressed and i loved with it while playing pubg i can easily able to notify the enemy with the sound at the gaming experience it is wonderful i love boat rockerz 510
dont read others reviews and just buy this piece if beautythey are very durable and the sound quality is good tooi am writing this review after a usage of 6 months and they are still very intact and the sound quality is same from day 1 i might have dropped them like 1012 times and there arent any scratches or damage
boats adding beats to my heart i am using it since 6 months everything is good and battery backup is awesome even i want to give an extra star for battery capacity and music masking of outer noise 55 and you can hear each string of music instruments absolutely recommended of music lover
nothing more to say about this product i am 100 satisfied using this productat this price range this headphone is top and giving good experience in audiowe can adjust the volume and experience the bass level i suggest this headset everyone who loves bass but be patience and wait for good offersbut one thing the battery backup is very very superb i think i got more than 12 hours in my daily 23 hours usagethanks to flipkart

if you want good bass and better sound clarity so i suggest go for it friends its best
bass is nice up to the mark and too sound quality also but using it for a long time ears are getting sweat apart from that all good worth for money
everything is goodbass music clearty headphones quality but i just feel left side ear sound is lower than right oneis that my headphone problem or thats how its should be im not sure about thatbut still im using it very good head phone just go for it dont think moreand i got it for 1399 in independence day scale so just wait for good offer time dont get it for 2k
good headphones bought two for my friend and me go for it good bass and best for music lover

amazing sound powerful bass excellent battery and awesome design
its an amazing product great and deep bass i insist you to do a extreme bass test from youtube it will really helpgreat looks it will take some time to get used to it but still it is comfortable the best products at this range
there is wonderful experience for me coz best headphones in budget price very good bass battery backup built quality also good bt the colour with black composition is not so good infact best for all kind of music lover
bro after using since 2 month i am totally satisfied by this productwhat a great baas in this headphone its very good in this range and battery backup amazing up to 15daysi always play pubj game for 3 hour and sound is quite amazingbro go ahead its true reviewits best than jbl headphones 2200 bro for great bass and battery backup go for same so have to purchase this
this is one of the best headphone looking just amazing its bass sound quality is too much good this is the best noice cancelling headphoneif you ask me about its ratingi say 20 out of 10yes see right me also right write
the battry backup is ultimate its more than 10 hours and that too when you listen loud the bass is fantastic youll love to hear 8d songs in the headphone the build is good but could be a bit better i believe
pros1 exceptional sound quality2 value for money cant get anything better at this price point 15993 instant bt connectivity4 it can act as wired headset too they come up with wire of 35 mm jack on both ends5 great build quality6 outstanding battery it just out passed my expectations by a great distancecons1 kinda heavy difficult to use it for longer period of time2 music is heard outside the ear plugs at high volumes actually this stopped me from giving 5 stars
stylish looks superb sound quality good bass long battery backup crystal clear voice while talking comfortable to wear good bluetooth range overall a fantastic purchase a must by for music lovers above all before time delivery by flipkart
to begin it is very nice i was going to purchase samsung level u then my friend suggested me this one so i ordered and i was bit doubtfull about the performence but i used it it was so satisfying if one have budget about 1500 then definatly go for this product some times if will show you 1999 but wait for the price if you want to same some cash i wait for 1 week and i got it only fot 1499 overall nice product specially for bass lovers
good product with amazing bass i bought it in an offer with price 1399 worth it really good 1 but u cant use this product at home as u wouldnt be able to hear any other sound fir to ek hi awaj aani h last mein bs ki es peo nu rkh deya kr kde lolz
best headphone in market at affordable price just try it once it is best for gaming purposeits bass is to good
superb in this range wired sound quality is way better than the bluetooth obviously bass quality is ttemendously well the battery back is like hulk it gave me near about 12hours in full volume of my mobile and this head set aux cable build quality very poor boat should work on that buletooth sound quality should be better in built mic is nice
all sounds great but its not that much comfortable its sweating after some time of use so its not that much comfortable need to improve on that part make ear fir design with comfort
nice product in this range sound quality is goodit is cristal clear sound but bass is not good as i expect battery backup is super and looking is daam awesome
it is a very good quality bluetooth headset with great battery backup sound quality is best noise cancellation not good buti am little disappointed with bluetooth mic while i make call i e it probably gives low sound to other end when i make a call
audio quality is good at this price tag design is also good but not comfortable for travellers should have been foldable pitch and clarity is also good only drawback is if you hear anything above half or near to full or full volumes then people around you can hear it clearly
this one is quite average in terms of sound quality but meet the expectations in the bass sector also battery backup is impressive it has a decent design and also the quality of cup pads is more than average its very comfortable and can be used for a long time there is no noticeable audio lag cons just one issue that there is an audio imbalance the sound has a right shift that sometimes is annoying
i have tried other company like iball n all i did got this one and found it really worth its good for calling its has bluetooth plus auxiliary cable which make it worth its connect well with my laptop n mobile i recommend to everyone in given budgetonly drawback is that i wish it could be foldable so that it can fit in my bag
i used it for more than 7 months every thing is great with a single disadvantage not easy to carryso for travelling purposes this is not a good choice if you want to use it for 2 to 3 hrs daily this is the best headphone it any headphone is not for a long use although it has good battery life this headphone is best in this range but for travelers i will not suggest this one youtravelers may go with if you want headphone only rockerz 400450 or 600 otherwise earphones are alwa
audio quality 45design built quality 45bass 45connectivity 45battery 55noise cancellation 55over all good i loved it and battery backup was really good

the best bluetooth headphone i purchased it for rs1399 on big shopping days excellent battery backup and performance and no complaints at all i like it and recommended for all
i have been using this headset for atleast 8 months simply too good specially i am impressed with battery backup excellent music quality it pairs very well with my oppo phone i am able to communicate very well using this headset though i have purchased many headset including boat 400 however i find this one simply better than others i have usedonly thing boat can improve in this headset is its look and design so that it matches with professional life
very good product charge service has been over one month so much better quality and good sound quality i like very good product
it is sooo good and soo good looking i love it sound quality is soo good good base battery backup is good
the audio quality is good and the battery backup is great there is little to no latency on bluetooth so you can even play games with this one the design is a bit flawed it hurts my ear if i wear it for a long time its too tight and presses hard against your ears softer ear cups may have solved it i wanted to give it 4 stars for the excellent battery backup and pretty good sound quality but it hurts my ear way too much to merit a 4 star rating
it is good product for listening music bass is good sound quality is good battery backup is good but when it comes to gaming it is good product but directional sounds or 3d sounds is ok ok not soo good but its ok
while u experience the sound quality you will feel awesome quality but the design is like muffler my friends told after three months it will be flexible enough to use
superb audio quality clear surround sound with good bass better than jbl headphone worth 7000
great deal for the pricewait for any big sale to buy it at best price talking of sound quality it went beyond expectations and its totally worth it build quality could be better

pros awesome sound quality good base 50nm drivers awesome battery backup best for 1599cons plastic design not good built quality my ears started to pain as i put it for half an hour not suitable for long time music listeners
sound is not good as wierd headphones but built quality and design is good 1star because i bought it in2000 and i think it deserves 1500 so not worth of every penny
it is very good product which is easy to use and operate its bass is pure and hard which is very useful for sounds its 3d sounds is like realbattery backup is 6 to 8 hourscomfortable in ear packedsounds are osmthe good thing in flipkart is its delivery is so fast in ekart dillip the delivery boy is very sensitive and faster in delivery

my friends out there dont worry you are getting the best thing for this price range has terrific battery backup sound quality is top notch but is low on punchy bass but its okay considering the price now on to design it is not that portable if you are looking to carry it around in your backpack but it can be easily wrap around your neck and is not at all uncomfortablefirst few days you might fell a little discomfort but later on you will love these from a true budge
i recently purchase boat rockerz 510 head phone is too good punchy bass not dhup dhup like dhumm dhummoverall i can say that the experince is satisfactory go on and purchase it and feel the music like a fly in the sky

one of the best gadget ever i have bought the battery backup is excellent its work more than one weekit works with aux cable alsoit is good for the bass lovers
best in its class superb controllable audio quality deep bass you can even notice the vibrations with bare hands from outside sound clarity is very much acceptable best youll get in this price range boat is basically jbl for those like me who cant afford overrated and overpriced jbl

i have just used them for a few days but i can feel the bass and it is awesomeif you want to look cool and feel that you just want headphones for there looks than you are looking at the right place but if you want your headphones to have quiet some good build quality than these are not made for youbut i think it is worth the price
i was using skull candy hesh 2 which was 4k but the bass and the treble and high pitch sound which i live for is just from the boat i love boat and im using their products for more than 3 years now not at all heavy best in the range got the deal at 14k
hey guys i do not believe on paid reviews but this ones not paid of course i have bought this headphone for rs1399 on offer i am gonna share my personal views after using it so lets start1 looks the boat rockerz come with a glossy near head cups and matt finish near top side they are super awesome2 sound quality they have super sound clarity and good quality you can feel the volume and all3bass they come with the best bass around this range i have tested the bass

one of the best product i purchased from flipkart at such a decent price of1400inrin starting i thought it was bulky and cause ear pair but using it for a week i got use to this product with no problemgreat bassyou can hear the minor details great builtgo for it without giving it a second thought
i have tested this product and the sound quality is awesome and base if songs is good and battery back is also good this is one the best quality one
wonderful product great noise clearance awesome sound experience and the bass is good enough also it boosts up the bass in regions where theres low level bass and that was good although its a good productone thing i found out was about the size it covers most of ur ear if you have a moderate sized ear adding to the good deeds its light i weightoverall rating is goodenjoyed it a lot
very good product but not comfortable and good for callingmiq is not working like earphones miqbaki sab mast hsize is too big
great headphones but if u using 2 hr then yr ear getting hot but overall headset really nice from other headset like jblskullcandyi purchase only 1399
attention its wonderful voice is jus excellent and i am happy 100 compatible with apple comes with a lot of features trust me its an incredible which i ever used i strongly recommend it for u people go for it wireless and wired both
sound quality is best and better with wire and tha bass is very good high bass and bulid quality like h premium but the on the wireless with bluetooth the high volume sound in minimum distortion it is good for this price range i like it
one wordsuperb awesome sound quality and good built product i got it at 1399 which is a very fair price this
wow fantastic productthanks to flipkart neice and very clear sound deep good extra bass and sound effect look very neice and feel the light weight to wear the head phone
okay sonot going to write a detailed reviewheadphones are pretty goodno doubti have only 2 issues 1sound quality is average 2your ears will start paining after 1530 minsi dont even use it anymore because of the painmy ears turn red after 25 mins of usagethis headset gives a gaming look to youi wouldnt recommend this for music the bass is goodbut sound quality not up to the mark
worth every penny the only problm i am facing is the sweat all my ears but thats okay only when you are out office use works perfectly in ac no sweat overall i find it as a good purchase
its been a month now after i bought this if you are person who loves bass and listening songs in high volume this will drive you crazy it have way too good battery life like for 3 days i guess and gets charged even faster but if u listen songs in low volume this is not ur cup of tea also if u take it to gym it will definitely slip over your head and will make u uncomfortable prolonged use may make u feel uncomfortable in your ears and definitely big enough that u cant wear it an
excellent product works very well and its quality is excellent
amazing great sound quality bass is amazing battery backup is great but a little bit uncomfortable for 12 days but after that u will get used to
i believe this headphone is great if we talk in terms of battery great sound great bass great things that i would like to get better enough would be its ear cushions which are not that good connectivity options only 1 device can be connected at a time and also i believe bluetooth version in the headphones should be upgradedas a customer looking for under rs2000 wireless headphones they are great
the headphone is awesome with the correct audio quality i have been using this for 7 months now and finds it comfortable to wear and listen tooeven when the sound of the headphones is to the maximum the output is fantastic durability is also up to the mark i even slept with these on for a few days and i dont have any problem the keys are easily accessible once you get familiar with thosethe battery backup is also very good as i had to charge my headphones only during 3 to 4 days as i h
writing this review after 20 days usesound quality good at this price 45bass its good but not hard as my last jbl headphones but at this price i will give 45noise cancellation its good but not the best 35design awesome 55comfort i feel a bit irritation after 1 hour use 35battery never charged for first 15 days 1 hour regular use so 65
my expectations had high but its not coverd yet not a bad product its pretty good with sound and design as well the prize was little bit more compared to other same featured product
bluetooth is not identified in my laptopand when i connect to my phone wifi only i can able to listen music but when i am trying to call the sound is not clear and the voice is not coming clear i tried with various phones so the sound is not clear during the call you can say the voice of the call is not clear enough to understand
the headphones are very awrsome because it has a crystal clear sound in listening music as well as in call the mic is also of good quality bass is awesome the aux which they give in the box is flatcablebattery backup is very very longlasting and even if it finishes you can use aux the only thing i hate is this headphones are not foldable or rotatable
this product is awesome in sound build quality as well as bass its a good product in this price range but its a bit big and not foldable which are the cons of this device overall a good product and worth the money
this is just awesome great features powerful bass with good sound quality awesome as well as beautiful product
its sound feel good in ear and no headache or migraine problem not happened after 3 hour of use it is solid built up but after long use you may feel some pain on the outer portions of your ear but overall product is good and very dashing looks and kudos to flip kart for timely delivery
first of all nice comfy beautiful looking for green lovers sound and bass quality is awesome and also battery backup
awesome purchasepros best sound quality and bass good battery backupcons if you wear 4050 minute continious then you will feel pain in ear head cusion is not good as ear one
this product worth money at this price segment this is one of the best bluetooth headphones available i use it for watching movies listening songs i liked it and recommend others also to buy this if interestedalso it has an amazing feature to connect to two devices at the same time to do this turn the headphones on while holding the volume up button and now you can connect to 2 devices simultaneously
what can i tell yougo for this product without any doubt base and sound quality can vary with mobile i have coolpad zenfone 5z and mi note 6 pro sound quality is best in 5z and 6 prowith and without aux but satisfactory in coolpadwithout aux also base quality with aux base quality without aux by the way i am completely satisfied with its performance considering its price segment
these headphonesboat never disappointsthis is my second boat headphone and the sound quality it has is just amazing plus the battery life you get is just great i would say if you want good sound and bass quality you go boat the design is great the only thing that bothers me is that it cant be folded as my earlier boat 400 was foldable and easy to fit in my bagtrust it occupies space but still i am loving this boat headphones are more than value for money
omg what a mindblowing bass cant explain overall best at this price build quality is good but may broke battery backup is very impressive bluetooth and mic is also good

great budget headphones under 2000 inr good build quality and its been a year im using this headphone and i am not regreting buying this headphone at this pricepoint moreover it has good battery life and backup also
sound bass and battery backup is too good like charge once and forget to charge again when you play music louder peoples standingsitting near you can hear it charged the battery on 7th april and using 34hrs daily after 13 days it shows battery 30 and running i think you have to charge it once in a month as it has the best battery backup
best headphones for bass as well as all types of song lovers reviewing after 34 months of use battery backup is just awesome bass is decent and also highs and mid tones balanced
nice products sound and bass are superbb design quality are well battery backup are also well and flipkart is very fast delivery this product before four days only one problem in this headphone after i use 15 years see in figure ear cubs
it is good for any music lovers as it provides clarity comfortable and price is good at rs 1499

awesome quality product its been 4 months im using them almost no complaints noise cancellation is good could have been improved bass is of better quality although it sucks at range cant take far from devices one of the best for gaming just a bit heavy and oversized but other than that no problemand yeah battery is huge man hope this helps
firstly thanks to flipkart for fast delivery headphone built design was awesome sound quality also excellent battery backup is too good when headphone delivered its 90 charge and am using since last 2 days now it 70 charge what a battery backup recommended for all superb product
its the best at this price range if u switch from earphones to this one it will take around 2 days to settle need carefull handling cze the main frame is of plastic its worth buying i m happy
superb product with good quality bass and sound best buy product in this price love boat
this is good product at this price but there are also some cons pros 1the sound quality is awesome 2 battery backup is good and you have an option to use it as a wired headphone when it discharged 3 the cushion is good and it feel comfortable over ear and head
